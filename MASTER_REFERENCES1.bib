The packet transport mechanism provided by Ethernet has been used to build systems which can be viewed as either local computer networks or loosely coupled multiprocessors. An Ethernet's shared communication facility, its Ether, is a passive broadcast medium with no central control. Coordination of access to the Ether for packet broadcasts is distributed among the contending transmitting stations using controlled statistical arbitration. Switching of packets to their destinations on the Ether is distributed among the receiving stations using packet address recognition. Design principles and implementation are described based on experience with an operating Ethernet of 100 nodes along a kilometer of coaxial cable. A model for estimating performance under heavy loads and a packet protocol for error controlled communication are included for completeness.},

In particular, we automatically specify and add pre-synthesized fault-tolerance components to programs in the cases where existing heuristics fail to add fault-tolerance. Such addition of pre-synthesized components has the advantage of reusing pre-synthesized fault-tolerance components in the synthesis of different programs, and as a result, reusing the effort put in the synthesis of one program for the synthesis of another program. Our synthesis method is sound in that the synthesized fault-tolerant program satisfies its specification in the absence of faults, and provides desired level of faulttolerance in the presence of faults. We illustrate our synthesis method by adding pre-synthesized components with linear topology to a token ring program that tolerates the corruption of all processes. Also, we have reused the same component in the synthesis of a fault-tolerant alternating bit protocol. Elsewhere, we have applied this method for adding presynthesized components with hierarchical topology.},

@article{Steggles1998,
	abstract = {SDL is an industrial standard formal description technique for telecommunication systems. Despite its wide spread use and industrial importance it lacks at present an adequate formal semantics integrating its static, dynamic, and real-time aspects. Timed Rewriting Logic (TRL) is a new variant of Rewriting Logic, an algebraic formalism which allows the dynamic behaviour of systems to be axiomatised using rewrite rules. In TRL rewrite rules can be labelled with time constraints and this provides a means of reasoning about time elapse in real-time systems. TRL has been used to develop an object-oriented specification language Timed Maude for distributed real-time systems. In this paper we demonstrate the expressive power and versatility of Timed Maude by applying it to the definition of a formal semantics for SDL. The semantics we develop captures in an intuitive way the hierarchical structure of SDL specifications and integrates within one formalism the static and dynamic aspects of an SDL system. We demonstrate and motivate the semantics we develop by considering in detail a case study of the bench mark alternating bit protocol. It is a pleasure to thank U. Hinkel, K. Meinke and M. Wirsing for their helpful comments and advice during the preparation of this paper. We also gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the British Council and DAAD which has made this collaborative work possible.},

The primary purpose of this interconnection was resource sharing, whereby persons and programs at one research center might access data and interactively use programs that exist and run in other computers of the network. The interconnection was to be realized using wideband leased lines and the technique of message switching, wherein a dedicated path is not set up between computers desiring to communicate, but instead the communication takes place through a sequence of messages each of which carries an address. A message generally traverses several network nodes in going from source to destination, and at each node a copy of the message is stored until it is safely received at the following node.},

First, we conduct a comprehensive study of system failures caused by this fault in 13 popular systems. Our study reveals that the studied failures are catastrophic (e.g., lead to data loss), easily manifest, and are mainly due to design laws. Our analysis identiies vulnerabilities in core systems mechanisms including scheduling, membership management, and ZooKeeper-based coniguration management. Second, we dissect the design of nine popular systems and identify four principled approaches for tolerating partial partitions. Unfortunately, our analysis shows that implemented fault tolerance techniques are inadequate for modern systems; they either patch a particular mechanism or lead to a complete cluster shutdown, even when alternative network paths exist. Finally, our indings motivate us to build Nifty, a transparent communication layer that masks partial network partitions. Nifty builds an overlay between nodes to detour packets around partial partitions. Nifty provides an approach for applications to optimize their operation during a partial partition. We demonstrate the beneit of this approach through integrating Nifty with VoltDB, HDFS, and Kafka.

The concept of ``direct coupling'' between interactiing finite state components is used to describe a hierarchical structure of protocol layers. The paper discusses different aspects of protocol validation, some verification tools based on the finite state formalism, and the basic limitations of the finite state modelling of protocols. An ``empty medium abstraction'' is proposed for reducing the complexity of the overall system description. The concept of ``adjoint states'' can be useful for summarizing the relative synchronization between the communicating system components. These concepts are applied to the analysis of a simple alternating bit protocol, and to the X.25 call set-up and clearing procedures. The analysis of X.25 shows that the procedures are stable in respect to intermittant perturbations in the synchronization of the interface introduced for different reasons, including occasional packet loss. However, on very rare occasions, an undesirable cyclic behaviour could be encountered.},

	abstract = {This paper reports our experiences implementing remote procedure call (RPC) protocols in the x-kernel. This exercise is interesting because the RPC protocols exploit two novel design techniques: virtual protocols and layered protocols. These techniques are made possible because the x-kernel provides an object-oriented infrastructure that supports three significant features: a uniform interface to all protocols, a late binding between protocol layers, and a small overhead for invoking any given protocol layer. For each design technique, the paper motivates the technique with a concrete example, describes how it is applied to the implementation of RPC protocols, and presents the results of experiments designed to evaluate the technique.},

@article{Abramsky2012,
	abstract = {Bell inequalities play a central role in the study of quantum nonlocality and entanglement, with many applications in quantum information. Despite the huge literature on Bell inequalities, it is not easy to find a clear conceptual answer to what a Bell inequality is, or a clear guiding principle as to how they may be derived. In this paper, we introduce a notion of logical Bell inequality which can be used to systematically derive testable inequalities for a very wide variety of situations. There is a single clear conceptual principle, based on purely logical consistency conditions, which underlies our notion of logical Bell inequalities. We show that in a precise sense, all Bell inequalities can be taken to be of this form. Our approach is very general. It applies directly to any family of sets of commuting observables. Thus it covers not only the n-partite scenarios to which Bell inequalities are standardly applied, but also Kochen-Specker configurations, and many other examples. There is much current work on experimental tests for contextuality. Our approach directly yields, in a systematic fashion, testable inequalities for a very general notion of contextuality. There has been much work on obtaining proofs of Bell's theorem ``without inequalities'' or ``without probabilities.'' These proofs are seen as being in a sense more definitive and logically robust than the inequality-based proofs. On the hand, they lack the fault-tolerant aspect of inequalities. Our approach reconciles these aspects, and in fact shows how the logical robustness can be converted into systematic, general derivations of inequalities with provable violations. Moreover, the kind of strong non-locality or contextuality exhibited by the GHZ argument or by Kochen-Specker configurations can be shown to lead to maximal violations of the corresponding logical Bell inequalities. Thus the qualitative and the quantitative aspects are combined harmoniously.},

I raise two complications for this approach. First, our spacetime concept seems to have the structure of a cluster concept, which means that Knox's inertial criteria for spacetime cannot succeed with complete generality. Second, the notion of metaphysical fundamentality may feature in the spacetime concept, in which case spacetime functionalism may be uninformative in the absence of answers to fundamental metaphysical questions like the substantivalist/relationist debate.},

It is theoretically interesting to know if we need to assume the validity of quantum theory to prove the security of quantum key distribution, or whether its security can be based on other physical principles. The question would also be of practical interest if quantum mechanics were ever to fail in some regime, because a scientifically and technologically advanced eavesdropper could perhaps use postquantum physics to extract information from quantum communications without necessarily causing the quantum state disturbances on which existing security proofs rely. Here we describe a key distribution scheme provably secure against general attacks by a postquantum eavesdropper limited only by the impossibility of superluminal signaling. Its security stems from violation of a Bell inequality.},

@article{Barrett2002,
	abstract = {In the analysis of experiments designed to reveal violation of Bell-type inequalities, it is usually assumed that any hidden variables associated with the nth particle pair would be independent of measurement choices and outcomes for the first (n−1) pairs. Models which violate this assumption exploit what we call the memory loophole. We focus on the strongest type of violation, which uses the two-sided memory loophole, in which the hidden variables for pair n can depend on the previous measurement choices and outcomes in both wings of the experiment. We show that the two-sided memory loophole allows a systematic violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality when the data are analyzed in the standard way, but cannot produce a violation if a CHSH expression depending linearly on the data is used. In the first case, the maximal CHSH violation becomes small as the number of particle pairs tested becomes large. Hence, although in principle the memory loophole implies a slight flaw in the existing analyses of Bell experiments, the data still strongly confirm quantum mechanics against local hidden variables. We consider also a related loophole, the simultaneous measurement loophole, which applies if all measurements on each side are carried out simultaneously. We show that this can increase the probability of violating the linearized CHSH inequality as well as other Bell-type inequalities.},

	abstract = {Asynchronous frameworks for distributed embedded systems, like ROS and MQTT, are increasingly used in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, where the cost of unintended behavior is high. The coordination mechanism between the components in these frameworks, however, gives rise to nondeterminism, where factors such as communication timing can lead to arbitrary ordering in the handling of messages. In this paper, we demonstrate the significance of this problem in an open-source full-stack autonomous driving software, Autoware.Auto 1.0, which relies on ROS 2. We give an alternative: Xronos, an open-source framework for distributed embedded systems that has a novel coordination strategy with predictable properties under clearly stated assumptions. If these assumptions are violated, Xronos provides for application-specific fault handlers to be invoked. We port Autoware.Auto to Xronos and show that it avoids the identified problems with manageable cost in end-to-end latency. Furthermore, we compare the maximum throughput of Xronos to ROS 2 and MQTT using microbenchmarks under different settings, including on three different hardware configurations, and find that it can match or exceed those frameworks in terms of throughput.},

@article{Both2023,
	abstract = {Graph layout algorithms used in network visualization represent the first and the most widely used tool to unveil the inner structure and the behavior of complex networks. Current network visualization software relies on the force-directed layout (FDL) algorithm, whose high computational complexity makes the visualization of large real networks computationally prohibitive and traps large graphs into high energy configurations, resulting in hard-to-interpret "hairball" layouts. Here we use Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to accelerate FDL, showing that deep learning can address both limitations of FDL: it offers a 10 to 100 fold improvement in speed while also yielding layouts which are more informative. We analytically derive the speedup offered by GNN, relating it to the number of outliers in the eigenspectrum of the adjacency matrix, predicting that GNNs are particularly effective for networks with communities and local regularities. Finally, we use GNN to generate a three-dimensional layout of the Internet, and introduce additional measures to assess the layout quality and its interpretability, exploring the algorithm's ability to separate communities and the link-length distribution. The novel use of deep neural networks can help accelerate other network-based optimization problems as well, with applications from reaction-diffusion systems to epidemics.},

@article{Buldyrev2010,
	abstract = {Complex networks have been studied intensively for a decade, but research still focuses on the limited case of a single, non-interacting network. Modern systems are coupled together and therefore should be modelled as interdependent networks. A fundamental property of interdependent networks is that failure of nodes in one network may lead to failure of dependent nodes in other networks. This may happen recursively and can lead to a cascade of failures. In fact, a failure of a very small fraction of nodes in one network may lead to the complete fragmentation of a system of several interdependent networks. A dramatic real-world example of a cascade of failures ('concurrent malfunction') is the electrical blackout that affected much of Italy on 28 September 2003: the shutdown of power stations directly led to the failure of nodes in the Internet communication network, which in turn caused further breakdown of power stations. Here we develop a framework for understanding the robustness of interacting networks subject to such cascading failures. We present exact analytical solutions for the critical fraction of nodes that, on removal, will lead to a failure cascade and to a complete fragmentation of two interdependent networks. Surprisingly, a broader degree distribution increases the vulnerability of interdependent networks to random failure, which is opposite to how a single network behaves. Our findings highlight the need to consider interdependent network properties in designing robust networks.},

Questions addressed by these theories include: Which resources can be converted into which others? At what rate can many copies of one resource be converted into many copies of another? Can a catalyst enable a conversion? How to quantify a resource? We propose a general mathematical definition of resource theory. We prove general theorems about how resource theories can be constructed from theories of processes with a subclass of processes that are freely implementable. These define the means by which costly states and processes can be interconverted. We outline how various existing resource theories fit into our framework, which is a first step in a project of identifying universal features and principles of resource theories. We develop a few general results concerning resource convertibility.},

@article{Cohen2015,
	abstract = {Lock-free data-structures are widely employed in practice, yet designing lock-free memory reclamation for them is notoriously difficult. In particular, all known lock-free reclamation schemes are ``manual'' in the sense that the developer has to specify when nodes have retired and may be reclaimed. Retiring nodes adequately is non-trivial and often requires the modification of the original lock-free algorithm. In this paper we present an automatic lock-free reclamation scheme for lock-free data-structures in the spirit of a mark-sweep garbage collection. The proposed algorithm works with any normalized lock-free algorithm and with no need for the programmer to retire nodes or make changes to the algorithm. Evaluation of the proposed scheme on a linked-list and a hash table shows that it performs similarly to the best manual (lock-free) memory reclamation scheme.},

It separates the issues and provides new perspectives on absolute relational accounts of motion and relational-substantival accounts of the ontology of space time.Earman's sustained treatment and imaginative insights raise to a new level the debate on these important issues at the boundary of philosophy and physics. He surveys the history of the controversy from Newton to Einstein develops the mathematics and physics needed to pose the issues in sharp form and provides a persuasive assessment of the philosophical problems involved.Most importantly, Earman revitalizes the connection of the debate to contemporary science. He shows, for example, how concerns raised by Leibniz form the core of ongoing debate on the foundations of general theory of relativity, moving the discussion into a new and vital arena and introducing arguments that will be discussed for years to come.John Earman is Professor of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Pittsburgh.

However, this static configuration makes introducing flexible changes to a TSN system at runtime very hard. Scenarios of adaptive TSN networks envision that the network configuration evolves with time in accordance with anticipated changes, such as the dynamicity of machine formations and machine reconfigurations. In this paper, we propose a notion of flexibility of scheduler configurations along a network path that facilitates introducing changes to TSN network configurations at runtime. Based on this notion, we develop and analyze algorithms to incrementally reconfigure TSN using the Time-Aware Shaper. These reconfigurations include determining the admissibility of new or changed streams that may possess individual deadlines.},

	abstract = {We analyze the performance of a quantum computer architecture combining a small processor and a storage unit. By focusing on integer factorization, we show a reduction by several orders of magnitude of the number of processing qubits compared with a standard architecture using a planar grid of qubits with nearest-neighbor connectivity. This is achieved by taking advantage of a temporally and spatially multiplexed memory to store the qubit states between processing steps. Concretely, for a characteristic physical gate error rate of 10−3, a processor cycle time of 1 microsecond, factoring a 2 048-bit RSA integer is shown to be possible in 177 days with 3D gauge color codes assuming a threshold of 0.75\% with a processor made with 13 436 physical qubits and a memory that can store 28 million spatial modes and 45 temporal modes with 2 hours' storage time. By inserting additional error-correction steps, storage times of 1 second are shown to be sufficient at the cost of increasing the run-time by about 23\%. Shorter run-times (and storage times) are achievable by increasing the number of qubits in the processing unit. We suggest realizing such an architecture using a microwave interface between a processor made with superconducting qubits and a multiplexed memory using the principle of photon echo in solids doped with rare-earth ions.},

@incollection{Hagar2022,
	abstract = {Combining physics, mathematics and computer science, quantum computingand its sister discipline of quantum information have developed in the past few decades from visionary ideas to two ofthe most fascinating areas of quantum theory. General interest andexcitement in quantum computing was initially triggered by Peter Shor(1994) who showed how a quantum algorithm could exponentially``speed-up'' classical computation and factor large numbersinto primes far more efficiently than any (known) classical algorithm.Shor's algorithm was soon followed by several other algorithmsthat aimed to solve combinatorial and algebraic problems, and in theyears since theoretical study of quantum systems serving ascomputational devices has achieved tremendous progress. Common beliefhas it that the implementation of Shor's algorithm on a largescale quantum computer would have devastating consequences for currentcryptography protocols which rely on the premise that all knownclassical worst-case algorithms for factoring take timeexponential in the length of their input (see, e.g., Preskill 2005).Consequently, experimentalists around the world are engaged inattempts to tackle the technological difficulties that prevent therealisation of a large scale quantum computer. But regardless whetherthese technological problems can be overcome (Unruh 1995; Ekert andJozsa 1996; Haroche and Raimond 1996), it is noteworthy that no proofexists yet for the general superiority of quantum computersover their classical counterparts., The philosophical interest in quantum computing is manifold. From asocial-historical perspective, quantum computing is a domain whereexperimentalists find themselves ahead of their fellow theorists.Indeed, quantum mysteries such as entanglement and nonlocality were historically considered a philosophical quibble, untilphysicists discovered that these mysteries might be harnessed todevise new efficient algorithms. But while the technology forharnessing the power of 50--100 qubits (the basic unit of informationin the quantum computer) is now within reach (Preskill 2018), only ahandful of quantum algorithms exist, and the question of whether thesecan truly outperform any conceivable classical alternative is stillopen. From a more philosophical perspective, advances in quantumcomputing may yield foundational benefits. For example, it may turnout that the technological capabilities that allow us to isolatequantum systems by shielding them from the effects of decoherence for a period of time long enough to manipulate them will also allowus to make progress in some fundamental problems in the foundations ofquantum theory itself. Indeed, the development and the implementationof efficient quantum algorithms may help us understand better theborder between classical and quantum physics (Cuffaro 2017, 2018a; cf.Pitowsky 1994, 100), and perhaps even illuminate fundamental conceptssuch as measurement and causality. Finally, the idea that abstract mathematical concepts such ascomputability and complexity may not only betranslated into physics, but also re-written by physics bearsdirectly on the autonomous character of computer science and thestatus of its theoretical entities---the so-called``computational kinds''. As such it is also relevant to thelong-standing philosophical debate on the relationship betweenmathematics and the physical world.},

	abstract = {Quantum theory is a probabilistic theory with fixed causal structure. General relativity is a deterministic theory but where the causal structure is dynamic. It is reasonable to expect that quantum gravity will be a probabilistic theory with dynamic causal structure. The purpose of this paper is to present a framework for such a probability calculus. We define an operational notion of space-time, this being composed of elementary regions. Central to this formalism is an object we call the causaloid. This object captures information about causal structure implicit in the data by quantifying the way in which the number of measurements required to establish a state for a composite region is reduced when there is a causal connection between the component regions. This formalism puts all elementary regions on an equal footing. It does not require that we impose fixed causal structure. In particular, it is not necessary to assume the existence of a background time. Remarkably, given the causaloid, we can calculate all relevant probabilities and so the causaloid is sufficient to specify the predictive aspect of a physical theory. We show how certain causaloids can be represented by suggestive diagrams and we show how to represent both classical probability theory and quantum theory by a causaloid. We do not give a causaloid formulation for general relativity though we speculate that this is possible. The work presented here suggests a research program aimed at finding a theory of quantum gravity. The idea is to use the causaloid formalism along with principles taken from the two theories to marry the dynamic causal structure of general relativity with the probabilistic structure of quantum theory.},

Axiom 5 (which requires that there exists continuous reversible transformations between pure states) rules out classical probability theory. If Axiom 5 (or even just the word "continuous" from Axiom 5) is dropped then we obtain classical probability theory instead.

The following operational postulates are shown to be equivalent to these mathematical axioms: [P1] Sharpness. Associated with any given pure state is a unique maximal effect giving probability equal to one. This maximal effect does not give probability equal to one for any other pure state.

There exists a compound reversible transformation on any system effecting any given permutation of any given maximal set of distinguishable states for that system. [P5] Sturdiness. Filters are non-flattening.

	abstract = {In this paper, we provide what might be regarded as a manifestly covariant presentation of discrete quantum theory. A typical quantum experiment has a bunch of apparatuses placed so that quantum systems can pass between them. We regard each use of an apparatus, along with some given outcome on the apparatus (a certain detector click or a certain meter reading for example), as an operation. An operation (e.g. Bb2a3a1) can have zero or more quantum systems inputted into it and zero or more quantum systems outputted from it. The operation Bb2a3a1 has one system of type a inputted, and one system of type b and one system of type a outputted. We can wire together operations to form circuits, for example, . Each repeated integer label here denotes a wire connecting an output to an input of the same type. As each operation in a circuit has an outcome associated with it, a circuit represents a set of outcomes that can happen in a run of the experiment. In the operator tensor formulation of quantum theory, each operation corresponds to an operator tensor. For example, the operation Bb2a3a1 corresponds to the operator tensor . Further, the probability for a general circuit is given by replacing operations with corresponding operator tensors as in

Repeated integer labels indicate that we multiply in the associated subspace and then take the partial trace over that subspace. Operator tensors must be physical (namely, they must have positive input transpose and satisfy a certain normalization condition).},

	abstract = {General relativity is a deterministic theory with non-fixed causal structure. Quantum theory is a probabilistic theory with fixed causal structure. In this paper, we build a framework for probabilistic theories with non-fixed causal structure. This combines the radical elements of general relativity and quantum theory. We adopt an operational methodology for the purposes of theory construction (though without committing to operationalism as a fundamental philosophy). The key idea in the construction is physical compression. A physical theory relates quantities. Thus, if we specify a sufficiently large set of quantities (this is the compressed set), we can calculate all the others. We apply three levels of physical compression. First, we apply it locally to quantities (actually probabilities) that might be measured in a particular region of spacetime. Then we consider composite regions. We find that there is a second level of physical compression for a composite region over and above the first level physical compression for the component regions. Each application of first and second level physical compression is quantified by a matrix. We find that these matrices themselves are related by the physical theory and can therefore be subject to compression. This is the third level of physical compression. The third level of physical compression gives rise to a new mathematical object which we call the causaloid. From the causaloid for a particular physical theory we can calculate everything the physical theory can calculate. This approach allows us to set up a framework for calculating probabilistic correlations in data without imposing a fixed causal structure (such as a background time). We show how to put quantum theory in this framework (thus providing a new formulation of this theory). We indicate how general relativity might be put into this framework and how the framework might be used to construct a theory of quantum gravity.},

              Very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of active galactic nuclei at millimetre wavelengths have the power to reveal the launching and initial collimation region of extragalactic radio jets, down to 10--100 gravitational radii (

              . It bridges the gap in mass and accretion rate between the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in Messier 87 and our Galactic Centre. A large southern declination of −43$\,^{\circ}$ has, however, prevented VLBI imaging of Centaurus A below a wavelength of 1 cm thus far. Here we show the millimetre VLBI image of the source, which we obtained with the Event Horizon Telescope at 228 GHz. Compared with previous observations

              , we image the jet of Centaurus A at a tenfold higher frequency and sixteen times sharper resolution and thereby probe sub-lightday structures. We reveal a highly collimated, asymmetrically edge-brightened jet as well as the fainter counterjet. We find that the source structure of Centaurus A resembles the jet in Messier 87 on {\textasciitilde}500

              should be visible at terahertz frequencies. This location further supports the universal scale invariance of black holes over a wide range of masses

	abstract = {Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) have emerged as the key on-chip communication architecture for multiprocessor systems-on-chip and chip multiprocessors. Single-hop non-blocking networks have the advantage of providing uniform latency and throughput, which is important for cachecoherent NoC systems. Existing work shows that Benes networks have much lower transistor count and smaller circuit area but longer delay than crossbars. To reduce the delay, we propose to design the Clos network built with larger size switches. Using less than half number of stages than the Benes network, the Clos network with 4x4 switches can significantly reduce the delay. This dissertation focuses on designing high performance Benes/Clos on-chip interconnection networks and implementing the switch setting circuits for these networks. The major contributions are summarized below: 
{\textless}ul{\textgreater} 
{\textless}li{\textgreater}The circuit designs of both Benes and Clos networks in different sizes are conducted considering two types of implementation of the configurable switch: with NMOS transistors only and full transmission gates (TGs). The layout and simulation results under 45nm technology show that TG-based Benes networks have much better delay and power performance than their NMOS-based counterparts, though more transistor resources are needed in TG-based designs. Clos networks achieve average 60\% lower delay than Benes networks with even smaller area and power consumption.{\textless}/li{\textgreater} 
{\textless}li{\textgreater}The Lee's switch setting algorithm is fully implemented in RTL and synthesized. We have refined the algorithm in data structure and initialization/updating of relation values to make it suitable for hardware implementation. The simulation and synthesis results of the switching setting circuits for 4x4 to 64x64 Benes networks under 65nm technology confirm that the trend of delay and area results of the circuit is consistent with that of the Lee's algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first complete hardware implementation of the parallel switch setting algorithm which can handle all types of permutations including partial ones.{\textless}/li{\textgreater}

The results in this dissertation confirm that the Benes/Clos networks are promising solution to implement on-chip interconnection network.},

Consistency is agreement on the values of shared variables; availability is the ability to respond to reads and writes accessing those shared variables. Availability is a real-time property whereas consistency is a logical property. We have extended the CAP theorem to relate quantitative measures of these two properties to quantitative measures of communication and computation latency (L), obtaining a relation called the CAL theorem that is linear in a max-plus algebra. This paper shows how to use the CAL theorem in various ways to help design real-time systems. We develop a methodology for systematically trading off availability and consistency in application-specific ways and to guide the system designer when putting functionality in end devices, in edge computers, or in the cloud. We build on the Lingua Franca coordination language to provide system designers with concrete analysis and design tools to make the required tradeoffs in deployable software.},

	abstract = {In distributed applications, Brewer's CAP theorem tells us that when networks become partitioned, there is a tradeoff between consistency and availability. Consistency is agreement on the values of shared variables across a system, and availability is the ability to respond to reads and writes accessing those shared variables. We quantify these concepts, giving numerical values to inconsistency and unavailability. Recognizing that network partitioning is not an all-or-nothing proposition, we replace the P in CAP with L, a numerical measure of apparent latency, and derive the CAL theorem, an algebraic relation between inconsistency, unavailability, and apparent latency. This relation shows that if latency becomes unbounded (e.g., the network becomes partitioned), then one of inconsistency and unavailability must also become unbounded, and hence the CAP theorem is a special case of the CAL theorem. We describe two distributed coordination mechanisms, which we have implemented as an extension of the Lingua Franca coordination language, that support arbitrary tradeoffs between consistency and availability as apparent latency varies. With centralized coordination, inconsistency remains bounded by a chosen numerical value at the cost that unavailability becomes unbounded under network partitioning. With decentralized coordination, unavailability remains bounded by a chosen numerical quantity at the cost that inconsistency becomes unbounded under network partitioning. Our centralized coordination mechanism is an extension of techniques that have historically been used for distributed simulation, an application where consistency is paramount. Our decentralized coordination mechanism is an extension of techniques that have been used in distributed databases when availability is paramount.},

	abstract = {The correctness of a time-critical system is closely related to the time of responding and performing every event. Our motivation example, alternating bit protocol, and application example, multi-track level crossing with sensors, both demonstrate that some nondeterministic behaviours can take place if the time associated with events is configured inappropriately or some concurrent events are controlled imperfectly in an overlapping period. These nondeterministic behaviours decrease the reliability and/or safety of a time-critical system. Therefore, it is valuable to formalise and check (non)determinacy. Time Petri Nets (TPN) in which the firing of every event is limited to a fix time interval are used to model time-critical systems in this article. We proposes a novel notion for TPN named time-soundness. It guarantees that the system always owns deterministic behaviours after any event is performed no matter when the event is performed. We utilise the notion of bisimulation to prove that the time-soundness can guarantee the behavioural determinacy. We propose an algorithm to check time-soundness, develop the related tool, and do experiments to show the usefulness and effectiveness of our notion and method.},

@misc{Lu2023,
	abstract = {Strictly serializable datastores greatly simplify the development of correct applications by providing strong consistency guarantees. However, existing techniques pay unnecessary costs for naturally consistent transactions, which arrive at servers in an order that is already strictly serializable. We find these transactions are prevalent in datacenter workloads. We exploit this natural arrival order by executing transaction requests with minimal costs while optimistically assuming they are naturally consistent, and then leverage a timestamp-based technique to efficiently verify if the execution is indeed consistent. In the process of designing such a timestamp-based technique, we identify a fundamental pitfall in relying on timestamps to provide strict serializability, and name it the timestamp-inversion pitfall. We find timestamp-inversion has affected several existing works. We present Natural Concurrency Control (NCC), a new concurrency control technique that guarantees strict serializability and ensures minimal costs -- i.e., one-round latency, lock-free, and non-blocking execution -- in the best (and common) case by leveraging natural consistency. NCC is enabled by three key components: non-blocking execution, decoupled response control, and timestamp-based consistency check. NCC avoids timestamp-inversion with a new technique: response timing control, and proposes two optimization techniques, asynchrony-aware timestamps and smart retry, to reduce false aborts. Moreover, NCC designs a specialized protocol for read-only transactions, which is the first to achieve the optimal best-case performance while ensuring strict serializability, without relying on synchronized clocks. Our evaluation shows that NCC outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by an order of magnitude on many workloads.},

@article{Price2021,
	abstract = {A 2015 experiment by Hanson and Delft colleagues provided further confirmation that the quantum world violates the Bell inequalities, being the first Bell test to close two known experimental loopholes simultaneously. The experiment was also taken to provide new evidence of 'spooky action at a distance'. Here we argue for caution about the latter claim. The Delft experiment relies on entanglement swapping, and our main claim is that this geometry introduces an additional loophole in the argument from violation of the Bell inequalities to action at a distance: the apparent action at a distance may be an artifact of 'collider bias'. In the absence of retrocausality, the sensitivity of such experiments to this 'Collider Loophole' (CL) depends on the temporal relation between the entanglement swapping measurement C and the two measurements A and B between which we seek to infer a causal connection. CL looms large if the C is in the future of A and B, but not if C is in the past. The Delft experiment itself is the intermediate case, in which the separation is spacelike. We argue that this leaves it vulnerable to CL, unable to establish conclusively that it avoids it. An Appendix discusses the implications of permitting retrocausality for the issue of causal influence across entanglement swapping measurements.},

We show that many quantitative results can be read off a spacetime diagram by counting boxes, using a minimal amount of algebra. We use the Doppler Effect, in the spirit of the Bondi k-calculus, to motivate the method.},

	abstract = {Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are highly available data types conforming to strong eventual consistency. CRDTs do not need synchronization for concurrent updates and can resolve conflicts locally without extra coordination. In this paper, we introduce Log-Structured ConflictFree Replicated Data Types (LSCRDTs) that leverage the advantages of both CRDTs and append-only logs. We show that a log-based approach addresses several well-known challenges to using CRDTs. First, it facilitates a uniform approach to reversing operations. Second, it removes constraints such as exactly-once delivery and idempotence of operations which are commonly associated with operation-based CRDTs. Third, it provides robustness via efficient access to earlier versions of the data types. We select three commonly used CRDTs for our study: register, counter, and set. We show how each is implemented using LSCRDT, demonstrate the benefits achieved, and present an empirical evaluation of their performance.},

	abstract = {When should a given operational phenomenology be deemed to admit of a classical explanation? When it can be realized in a generalized-noncontextual ontological model. The case for answering the question in this fashion has been made in many previous works, and motivates research on the notion of generalized noncontextuality. Many criticisms and concerns have been raised, however, regarding the definition of this notion and of the possibility of testing it experimentally. In this work, we respond to some of the most common of these objections. One such objection is that the existence of a classical record of which laboratory procedure was actually performed in each run of an experiment implies that the operational equivalence relations that are a necessary ingredient of any proof of the failure of noncontextuality do not hold, and consequently that conclusions of nonclassicality based on these equivalences are mistaken. We explain why this concern in unfounded. Our response affords the opportunity for us to clarify certain facts about generalized noncontextuality, such as the possibility of having proofs of its failure based on a consideration of the subsystem structure of composite systems. Similarly, through our responses to each of the other objections, we elucidate some under-appreciated facts about the notion of generalized noncontextuality and experimental tests thereof.},

	abstract = {A standard approach to quantifying resources is to determine which operations on the resources are freely available, and to deduce the partial order over resources that is induced by the relation of convertibility under the free operations. If the resource of interest is the nonclassicality of the correlations embodied in a quantum state, i.e., entanglement, then the common assumption is that the appropriate choice of free operations is Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC). We here advocate for the study of a different choice of free operations, namely, Local Operations and Shared Randomness (LOSR), and demonstrate its utility in understanding the interplay between the entanglement of states and the nonlocality of the correlations in Bell experiments. Specifically, we show that the LOSR paradigm (i) provides a resolution of the anomalies of nonlocality, wherein partially entangled states exhibit more nonlocality than maximally entangled states, (ii) entails new notions of genuine multipartite entanglement and nonlocality that are free of the pathological features of the conventional notions, and (iii) makes possible a resource-theoretic account of the self-testing of entangled states which generalizes and simplifies prior results. Along the way, we derive some fundamental results concerning the necessary and sufficient conditions for convertibility between pure entangled states under LOSR and highlight some of their consequences, such as the impossibility of catalysis for bipartite pure states. The resource-theoretic perspective also clarifies why it is neither surprising nor problematic that there are mixed entangled states which do not violate any Bell inequality. Our results motivate the study of LOSR-entanglement as a new branch of entanglement theory.},

	abstract = {Using a process-theoretic formalism, we introduce the notion of a causal-inferential theory: a triple consisting of a theory of causal influences, a theory of inferences (of both the Boolean and Bayesian varieties), and a specification of how these interact. Recasting the notions of operational and realist theories in this mold clarifies what a realist account of an experiment offers beyond an operational account. It also yields a novel characterization of the assumptions and implications of standard no-go theorems for realist representations of operational quantum theory, namely, those based on Bell's notion of locality and those based on generalized noncontextuality. Moreover, our process-theoretic characterization of generalised noncontextuality is shown to be implied by an even more natural principle which we term Leibnizianity. Most strikingly, our framework offers a way forward in a research program that seeks to circumvent these no-go results. Specifically, we argue that if one can identify axioms for a realist causal-inferential theory such that the notions of causation and inference can differ from their conventional (classical) interpretations, then one has the means of defining an intrinsically quantum notion of realism, and thereby a realist representation of operational quantum theory that salvages the spirit of locality and of noncontextuality.},

Robots searching for common goals are complicated as they need to avoid collisions. We need to provide paths for all robots which should be collision free and should take less amount of time. Usually these algorithms use square tessellations in this type of investigations, which leads to the lack of variation and enlargement of neighborhood. In this paper we present the construction of a cellular automaton over triangular and hexagonal tessellations and show the complexity for the same. After going through various literatures on robot path planning most don't consider many objectives, like finding shortest path with least time taken and much less waiting time. This paper is unique in a way that apart from hexagonal tessellation we have given a triangular tessellation as well which adds to the efficiency of this paper.},

	abstract = {Double-slit experiments---where a wave is transmitted through a thin double aperture in space---have confirmed the wave--particle duality of quantum objects, such as single photons, electrons, neutrons, atoms and large molecules. Yet, the temporal counterpart of Young's double-slit experiment---a wave interacting with a double temporal modulation of an interface---remains elusive. Here we report such a time-domain version of the classic Young's double-slit experiment: a beam of light twice gated in time produces an interference in the frequency spectrum. The `time slits', narrow enough to produce diffraction at optical frequencies, are generated from the optical excitation of a thin film of indium tin oxide near its epsilon-near-zero point. The separation between time slits determines the period of oscillations in the frequency spectrum, whereas the decay of fringe visibility in frequency reveals the shape of the time slits. Surprisingly, many more oscillations are visible than expected from existing theory, implying a rise time that approaches an optical cycle. This result enables the further exploration of time-varying physics, towards the spectral synthesis of waves and applications such as signal processing and neuromorphic computation.},

In doing so we rediscover the ternary structures known as heaps and are able to give a more comprehensive treatment of their mergence in the context of dagger categories and their generalizations. Our key insight is to approach associativity as a confluence property of hypergraph rewrite systems. This approach allows us to define a notion of ternary category and heapoid, where morphisms bind three objects simultaneously, and suggests a systematic study of higher arity forms of associativity.},

In particular, we will see that it assumes that every router can be modeled as a node offering a minimum service curve that is a rate-latency function.We explain how this is used in a protocol such as RSVP. We also analyze the more efficient framework based on service curve scheduling. This allows us to address in a simple way the complex issue of schedulability.},

	abstract = {The Deutsch--Jozsa algorithm is a deterministic quantum algorithm proposed by David Deutsch and Richard Jozsa in 1992 with improvements by Richard Cleve, Artur Ekert, Chiara Macchiavello, and Michele Mosca in 1998. Although of little current practical use, it is one of the first examples of a quantum algorithm that is exponentially faster than any possible deterministic classical algorithm.The Deutsch--Jozsa problem is specifically designed to be easy for a quantum algorithm and hard for any deterministic classical algorithm. It is a black box problem that can be solved efficiently by a quantum computer with no error, whereas a deterministic classical computer would need a exponential number of queries to the black box to solve the problem. More formally, it yields an oracle relative to which EQP, the class of problems that can be solved exactly in polynomial time on a quantum computer, and P are different.Since the problem is easy to solve on a probabilistic classical computer, it does not yield an oracle separation with BPP, the class of problems that can be solved with bounded error in polynomial time on a probabilistic classical computer. Simon's problem is an example of a problem that yields an oracle separation between BQP and BPP.},

It was conceived in 1993 by Avshalom Elitzur and Lev Vaidman. Since their publication, real-world experiments have confirmed that their theoretical method works as predicted.The bomb tester takes advantage of two characteristics of elementary particles, such as photons or electrons: nonlocality and wave--particle duality. By placing the particle in a quantum superposition, it is possible for the experiment to verify that the bomb works without triggering its detonation, although there is still a 50\% chance that the bomb will detonate in the effort.},

@misc{2023c,
	abstract = {In computing, reactive programming is a declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change. With this paradigm, it's possible to express static (e.g., arrays) or dynamic (e.g., event emitters) data streams with ease, and also communicate that an inferred dependency within the associated execution model exists, which facilitates the automatic propagation of the changed data flow.For example, in an imperative programming setting, a := b + c would mean that a is being assigned the result of b + c in the instant the expression is evaluated, and later, the values of b and c can be changed with no effect on the value of a. On the other hand, in reactive programming, the value of a is automatically updated whenever the values of b or c change, without the program having to explicitly re-execute the statement a := b + c to determine the presently assigned value of a.

Another example is a hardware description language such as Verilog, where reactive programming enables changes to be modeled as they propagate through circuits.Reactive programming has been proposed as a way to simplify the creation of interactive user interfaces and near-real-time system animation.For example, in a model--view--controller (MVC) architecture, reactive programming can facilitate changes in an underlying model that are reflected automatically in an associated view.},

	citation_abstract = {A standard approach to quantifying resources is to determine which operations on the resources are freely available, and to deduce the partial order over resources that is induced by the relation of convertibility under the free operations. If the resource of interest is the nonclassicality of the correlations embodied in a quantum state, i.e., entanglement, then the common assumption is that the appropriate choice of free operations is Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC). We here advocate for the study of a different choice of free operations, namely, Local Operations and Shared Randomness (LOSR), and demonstrate its utility in understanding the interplay between the entanglement of states and the nonlocality of the correlations in Bell experiments. Specifically, we show that the LOSR paradigm (i) provides a resolution of the anomalies of nonlocality, wherein partially entangled states exhibit more nonlocality than maximally entangled states, (ii) entails new notions of genuine multipartite entanglement and nonlocality that are free of the pathological features of the conventional notions, and (iii) makes possible a resource-theoretic account of the self-testing of entangled states which generalizes and simplifies prior results. Along the way, we derive some fundamental results concerning the necessary and sufficient conditions for convertibility between pure entangled states under LOSR and highlight some of their consequences, such as the impossibility of catalysis for bipartite pure states. The resource-theoretic perspective also clarifies why it is neither surprising nor problematic that there are mixed entangled states which do not violate any Bell inequality. Our results motivate the study of LOSR-entanglement as a new branch of entanglement theory.},

	abstract = {Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with hidden variables are often used to characterize causal relations between variables in a system. When some variables are unobserved, DAGs imply a notoriously complicated set of constraints on the distribution of observed variables. In this work, we present entropic inequality constraints that are implied by \$e\$-separation relations in hidden variable DAGs with discrete observed variables. The constraints can intuitively be understood to follow from the fact that the capacity of variables along a causal pathway to convey information is restricted by their entropy; e.g. at the extreme case, a variable with entropy \$0\$ can convey no information. We show how these constraints can be used to learn about the true causal model from an observed data distribution. In addition, we propose a measure of causal influence called the minimal mediary entropy, and demonstrate that it can augment traditional measures such as the average causal effect.},

	abstract = {This document describes a correspondence between photons and propagating information packets (PIPs) that are emergent out of the Space Element Reduction Duplication (SERD) model. The SERD model is a discrete background independent microscopic space-time description. By observation of physically comparable behaviour emerging from this system, through analysis and computer simulation, we draw conclusions of what the form and dynamics of the true underlying space-time may be. By treating elements of the system as fundamental observers, mathematical and empirical evidence is obtained of the existence of fully emergent light-like cosmological horizons, implying the existance of causally separated pocket universes. The SERD model is a network of connected hyperedges called Point Particles (PPs) which represent the fundamental constituents of all matter and particles (and therefore observers) separated by strings of consecutive and fundamental elements called Space Elements (SE). The SEs duplicate and reduce while the PPs split and merge through discrete time. These are known as the actions of the elements and create a highly dynamic multi-way system. Elements have an awareness of the information around them and communicate with their nearest neighbours through time.},

@article{Lee2021a,
	abstract = {This article is about deterministic models, what they are, why they are useful, and what their limitations are. First, the article emphasizes that determinism is a property of models, not of physical systems. Whether a model is deterministic or not depends on how one defines the inputs and behavior of the model. To define behavior, one has to define an observer. The article compares and contrasts two classes of ways to define an observer, one based on the notion of ``state'' and another that more flexibly defines the observables. The notion of ``state'' is shown to be problematic and lead to nondeterminism that is avoided when the observables are defined differently. The article examines determinism in models of the physical world. In what may surprise many readers, it shows that Newtonian physics admits nondeterminism and that quantum physics may be interpreted as a deterministic model. Moreover, it shows that both relativity and quantum physics undermine the notion of ``state'' and therefore require more flexible ways of defining observables. Finally, the article reviews results showing that sufficiently rich sets of deterministic models are incomplete. Specifically, nondeterminism is inescapable in any system of models rich enough to encompass Newton's laws.},

	abstract = {Actors have become widespread in programming languages and programming frameworks focused on parallel and distributed computing. While actors provide a more disciplined model for concurrency than threads, their interactions, if not constrained, admit nondeterminism. As a consequence, actor programs may exhibit unintended behaviors and are less amenable to rigorous testing. We show that nondeterminism can be handled in a number of ways, surveying dataflow dialects, process networks, synchronous-reactive models, and discrete-event models. These existing approaches, however, tend to require centralized control, pose challenges to modular system design, or introduce a single point of failure. We describe ``reactors,'' a new coordination model that combines ideas from several of the aforementioned approaches to enable determinism while preserving much of the style of actors. Reactors promote modularity and allow for distributed execution. By using a logical model of time that can be associated with physical time, reactors also admit control over timing.},

@article{SchulzRosengarten2023,
	abstract = {Complex software systems often feature distinct modes of operation, each designed to handle a particular scenario that may require the system to respond in a certain way. Breaking down system behavior into mutually exclusive modes and discrete transitions between modes is a commonly used strategy to reduce implementation complexity and promote code readability. However, such capabilities often come in the form of self-contained domain specific languages or language-specific frameworks. The work in this paper aims to bring the advantages of modal models to mainstream programming languages, by following the polyglot coordination approach of Lingua Franca (LF), in which verbatim target code (e.g., C, C++, Python, Typescript, or Rust) is encapsulated in composable reactive components called reactors. Reactors can form a dataflow network, are triggered by timed as well as sporadic events, execute concurrently, and can be distributed across nodes on a network. With modal models in LF, we introduce a lean extension to the concept of reactors that enables the coordination of reactive tasks based on modes of operation. The implementation of modal reactors outlined in this paper generalizes to any LF-supported language with only modest modifications to the generic runtime system.},

This sensitivity can be increased quadratically by decreasing the photonic temporal bandwidth even at values smaller than the time delay when standard two-photon interferometers become inoperable and without adapting the path of the reference photon, nor the need of time-resolving detectors with an unfeasible high resolution. Applications can range from the more feasible imaging of nanostructures, including biological samples, and nanomaterial surfaces to quantum enhanced estimation based on frequency-resolved boson sampling in optical networks.},

Work is performed using a personal sequence of messages per long-running ``collaboration''.  An autonomous organization may want to leverage its shared resources to accomplish work with a business partner.

This talk starts by examining how work flows across autonomous boundaries and the intrinsic duality between the personal collaboration with a single partner and the management of resources shared across partners.

There is a duality of both personal and shared in all autonomous collaborations.},

This second talk explores how the patterns for autonomous work intrinsically break an application into many related pieces.  By structuring the internal interactions of the work WITHIN your autonomous organization, the many small pieces can be deployed on an ever increasing set of servers if needed for scale.  This is an application of the pattern describe in my earlier paper ``Life Beyond Distributed Transactions''.},

Entropy is surely one of the most perplexing concepts in physics. It's variously described as a measure of a system's disorder - or as the amount of useful work that you can get from it - or as the information hidden by the system. Despite the seeming ambiguity in its definition, many physicists hold entropy to be behind one of the most fundamental laws of physics.

The client interactive logic components have reference data and single user writable data and are charged with interacting with the client and with forming request that will be recognized by the primary logic component. However, unlike the conventional architecture, requests submitted from the client interactive logic components are not trusted by the primary logic component. Instead, information within the request is validated for accuracy before the request is honored. The service provider also assists in handling requests based on stale data by the client interactive logic component generating formal requests that are commutative and business service oriented, and by the primary logic component having policies that recognize the existence of stale data.},

@misc{Helland2009,
	abstract = {Reliable systems have always been built out of unreliable components. Early on, the reliable components were small such as mirrored disks or ECC (Error Correcting Codes) in core memory. These systems were designed such that failures of these small components were transparent to the application. Later, the size of the unreliable components grew larger and semantic challenges crept into the application when failures occurred. As the granularity of the unreliable component grows, the latency to communicate with a backup becomes unpalatable. This leads to a more relaxed model for fault tolerance. The primary system will acknowledge the work request and its actions without waiting to ensure that the backup is notified of the work. This improves the responsiveness of the system. There are two implications of asynchronous state capture: 1) Everything promised by the primary is probabilistic. There is always a chance that an untimely failure shortly after the promise results in a backup proceeding without knowledge of the commitment. Hence, nothing is guaranteed! 2) Applications must ensure eventual consistency. Since work may be stuck in the primary after a failure and reappear later, the processing order for work cannot be guaranteed. Platform designers are struggling to make this easier for their applications. Emerging patterns of eventual consistency and probabilistic execution may soon yield a way for applications to express requirements for a "looser" form of consistency while providing availability in the face of ever larger failures. This paper recounts portions of the evolution of these trends, attempts to show the patterns that span these changes, and talks about future directions as we continue to "build on quicksand".},

@article{Ziegler2023,
	abstract = {Many distributed cloud OLTP databases have settled on a sharedstorage design coupled with a single-writer. This design choice is remarkable since conventional wisdom promotes using a sharednothing architecture for building scalable systems. In this paper, we revisit the question of what a scalable OLTP design for the cloud should look like by analyzing the data access behavior of different systems. We find that a shared-storage design that supports multiple writers, combined with a coherent cache, has desirable properties for building scalable OLTP systems. For instance, this design provides scalability of writes and skewed reads by caching hot tuples on demand. At the same time, this design does not require user-defined partitioning and two-phase commit in contrast to a shared-nothing design. We present the lessons learned from building a multiple-writer cache-coherent cloud OLTP DBMS to show this architecture's merits and present open research challenges.},

@article{Harlow2017,
	abstract = {I argue that a version of the quantum-corrected Ryu-Takayanagi formula holds in any quantum error-correcting code. I present this result as a series of theorems of increasing generality, with the final statement expressed in the language of operator-algebra quantum error correction. In AdS/CFT this gives a "purely boundary" interpretation of the formula. I also extend a recent theorem, which established entanglement-wedge reconstruction in AdS/CFT, when interpreted as a subsystem code, to the more general, and I argue more physical, case of subalgebra codes. For completeness, I include a self-contained presentation of the theory of von Neumann algebras on finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, as well as the algebraic definition of entropy. The results confirm a close relationship between bulk gauge transformations, edge-modes/soft-hair on black holes, and the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. They also suggest a new perspective on the homology constraint, which basically is to get rid of it in a way that preserves the validity of the formula, but which removes any tension with the linearity of quantum mechanics. Moreover they suggest a boundary interpretation of the "bit threads" recently introduced by Freedman and Headrick.},

@article{Bao2015,
	abstract = {We initiate a systematic enumeration and classification of entropy inequalities satisfied by the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for conformal field theory states with smooth holographic dual geometries. For 2, 3, and 4 regions, we prove that the strong subadditivity and the monogamy of mutual information give the complete set of inequalities. This is in contrast to the situation for generic quantum systems, where a complete set of entropy inequalities is not known for 4 or more regions. We also find an infinite new family of inequalities applicable to 5 or more regions. The set of all holographic entropy inequalities bounds the phase space of Ryu-Takayanagi entropies, defining the holographic entropy cone. We characterize this entropy cone by reducing geometries to minimal graph models that encode the possible cutting and gluing relations of minimal surfaces. We find that, for a fixed number of regions, there are only finitely many independent entropy inequalities. To establish new holographic entropy inequalities, we introduce a combinatorial proof technique that may also be of independent interest in Riemannian geometry and graph theory.},

@article{Pastawski2015,
	abstract = {We propose a family of exactly solvable toy models for the AdS/CFT correspondence based on a novel construction of quantum error-correcting codes with a tensor network structure. Our building block is a special type of tensor with maximal entanglement along any bipartition, which gives rise to an isometry from the bulk Hilbert space to the boundary Hilbert space. The entire tensor network is an encoder for a quantum error-correcting code, where the bulk and boundary degrees of freedom may be identified as logical and physical degrees of freedom respectively. These models capture key features of entanglement in the AdS/CFT correspondence; in particular, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula and the negativity of tripartite information are obeyed exactly in many cases. That bulk logical operators can be represented on multiple boundary regions mimics the Rindler-wedge reconstruction of boundary operators from bulk operators, realizing explicitly the quantum error-correcting features of AdS/CFT recently proposed by Almheiri et. al in arXiv:1411.7041.},

@incollection{Zeyl2022,
	abstract = {In the Timaeus Plato presents an elaborately wrought accountof the formation of the universe and an explanation of its impressiveorder and beauty. The universe, he proposes, is the product ofrational, purposive, and beneficent agency. It is the handiwork of adivine Craftsman (``Demiurge,'' d{\^e}miourgos,28a6) who, imitating an unchanging and eternal model, imposesmathematical order on a preexistent chaos to generate the ordereduniverse (kosmos). The governing explanatory principle of theaccount is teleological: the universe as a whole as well as itsvarious parts are so arranged as to produce a vast array of goodeffects. For Plato this arrangement is not fortuitous, but the outcomeof the deliberate intent of Intellect (nous),anthropomorphically represented by the figure of the Craftsman whoplans and constructs a world that is as excellent as its naturepermits it to be., The beautiful orderliness of the universe is not only themanifestation of Intellect; it is also the model for rational souls tounderstand and to emulate. Such understanding and emulation restoresthose souls to their original state of excellence, a state that waslost in their embodiment. There is, then, an explicit ethical andreligious dimension to the discourse., This picture of a divinely created universe, though controversial fromthe start (see below, section 2), has captured the imagination andadmiration of numerous generations of philosophers and theologiansthrough the centuries.[1] Because of the vast scope of the work, as well as its character as amonologue---by excluding exchanges between interlocutors thediscourse is much more like an authoritative statement than a set ofquestions to be investigated---the Timaeus was generallytaken to be the culmination of its author's intellectualachievement, particularly by thinkers in sympathy with its portrayalof the universe. This also seems to have been one of the reasons forits early translation into Latin. Calcidius' Latin translationin the fourth century CE made it the only text of Plato available inthe Middle Ages in the Latin West until the twelfth century. While itstill was an important reference point for Kepler, its influence beganto wane over time. In the latter part of the nineteenth and earlierpart of the twentieth century interest in the Timaeus wasagain stimulated by the refinement of philological methods and exacthistorical scholarship,[2] but for most of the second half of the twentieth century the dialoguewas frequently dismissed as philosophically insignificant at best andregressive at worst. It played an important role in debates about thedevelopment of Plato's philosophy, but not much more. Recentdecades, however, have witnessed a strong revival of interest in theTimaeus: philosophers, historians of science and of ideas,and philologists, while not necessarily persuaded by thedialogue's bold claims, have been fascinated by its majesticaccount and have sympathetically entered into and sought to elucidateits conceptual structure.},

	abstract = {A key concern in modern distributed systems is to avoid the cost of coordination while maintaining consistent semantics. Until recently, there was no answer to the question of when coordination is actually required. In this paper we present an informal introduction to the CALM Theorem, which answers this question precisely by moving up from traditional storage consistency to consider properties of programs. CALM is an acronym for "consistency as logical monotonicity". The CALM Theorem shows that the programs that have consistent, coordination-free distributed implementations are exactly the programs that can be expressed in monotonic logic. This theoretical result has practical implications for developers of distributed applications. We show how CALM provides a constructive application-level counterpart to conventional "systems" wisdom, such as the apparently negative results of the CAP Theorem. We also discuss ways that monotonic thinking can influence distributed systems design, and how new programming language designs and tools can help developers write consistent, coordination-free code.},

	abstract = {Developing Field-programmable Gate Array (FPGA) architectures is challenging due to the competing requirements of various application domains and changing manufacturing process technology. This is compounded by the difficulty of fairly evaluating FPGA architectural choices, which requires sophisticated high-quality Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools to target each potential architecture. This article describes version 8.0 of the open source Verilog to Routing (VTR) project, which provides such a design flow. VTR 8 expands the scope of FPGA architectures that can be modelled, allowing VTR to target and model many details of both commercial and proposed FPGA architectures. The VTR design flow also serves as a baseline for evaluating new CAD algorithms. It is therefore important, for both CAD algorithm comparisons and the validity of architectural conclusions, that VTR produce high-quality circuit implementations. VTR 8 significantly improves optimization quality (reductions of 15\% minimum routable channel width, 41\% wirelength, and 12\% critical path delay), run-time (5.3× faster) and memory footprint (3.3× lower). Finally, we demonstrate VTR is run-time and memory footprint efficient, while producing circuit implementations of reasonable quality compared to highly-tuned architecture-specific industrial tools---showing that architecture generality, good implementation quality, and run-time efficiency are not mutually exclusive goals.},

	abstract = {Simulated annealing (SA) is one of the most common FPGA placement techniques, and is used both as a standalone algorithm and to improve an initial analytical placement. While SA-based placers can achieve high-quality results, they suffer from long runtimes. In this article, we introduce RLPlace, a novel SA-based FPGA placer that utilizes both reinforcement learning (RL) and targeted perturbations (directed moves). The proposed moves target both wirelength and timing optimization and explore the solution space more efficiently than traditional random moves while preventing oscillation in the Quality of Results (QoR). RL techniques are used to dynamically select the most effective move types as optimization progresses. The experimental results show that RLPlace outperforms the widely used VTR 8 placer across all runtime/quality tradeoff points, achieving better QoR placement solutions in less runtime. On average, across the Titan23 suite of large FPGA benchmarks, RLPlace can reduce CPU time by \$2.5{\textbackslash}times \$ with result quality comparable to VTR 8, or improve wirelength by 8\% (at a high CPU time budget) −26\% (at a low CPU time budget) versus VTR 8.0 given the same CPU time.},

	abstract = {FPGAs have traditionally been successful in accelerating stream processing applications where the amount and type of work performed on each record---e.g., image, packet---do not depend on the record's contents. On the other hand, accelerating `input-dependent' stream processing on FPGAs presents a much more challenging problem where different records in the stream can require widely different operations. It is inefficient and unnecessary to support all operations at the same throughput when the distributions of the operations are skewed. In this paper, we examine the application of the ``make the common case fast'' strategy to efficiently accelerate `input-dependent' stream processing on FPGAs. In particular, we study the use of fast-slow path and early-exit techniques in the design of an FPGA-accelerated network intrusion prevention system (IPS). To avoid overfitting when common-case behavior is varied, we further examine compile-time re-tuning and runtime adaptation techniques. A quantitative analysis shows that fast-slow path and early-exit techniques can save an order of magnitude of resources compared to a common-case unaware IPS design. Compile-time re-tuning to specific conditions further achieves 30\% -- 94\% BRAM savings relative to a generalized design. Adding runtime adaptation improves the zero-loss throughput by 1.43 -- 2.75 × compared to a fixed design.},

	abstract = {In recent years, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been increasingly deployed in datacenters as programmable accelerators that can offer software-like flexibility and custom-hardware-like efficiency for key datacenter workloads. To improve the efficiency of FPGAs for these new datacenter use cases and data-intensive applications, a new class of reconfigurable acceleration devices (RADs) is emerging. In these devices, the FPGA fine-grained reconfigurable fabric is a component of a bigger monolithic or multi-die system-in-package that can incorporate general-purpose software-programmable cores, domain-specialized accelerator blocks, and high-performance networks-on-chip (NoCs) for efficient communication between these system components. The integration of all these components in a RAD results in a huge design space and requires re-thinking the implementation of applications that need to be migrated from conventional FPGAs to these novel devices. In this work, we introduce RAD-Sim, an architecture simulator that allows rapid design space exploration for RADs and facilitates the study of complex interactions between their various components. We also present a case study that highlights the utility of RAD-Sim in re-designing applications for these novel RADs by mapping a state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) inference FPGA overlay to different RAD instances. Our case study illustrates how RAD-Sim can capture a wide variety of reconfigurable architectures, from conventional FPGAs to devices augmented with hard NoCs, specialized matrix-vector blocks, and 3D-stacked multi-die devices. In addition, we show that our tool can help architects evaluate the effect of specific RAD architecture parameters on end-to-end workload performance. Through RAD-Sim, we also show that novel RADs can potentially achieve \$2.6{\textbackslash}times \$ better performance on average compared to conventional FPGAs in the key DL application domain.},

In this paper we set an ambitious goal: Can we do all of the above in a single server? Through the Pigasus IDS/IPS, we show that this goal is achievable, perhaps for the first time, by building on recent advances in FPGA-capable SmartNICs. Pigasus' design takes an FPGA-first approach, where the majority of processing, and all state and control flow are managed on the FPGA. However, doing so requires careful design of algorithms and data structures to ensure fast common-case performance while densely utilizing system memory resources.

The high computational complexity of AI algorithms and the stringent latency constraints for datacenter workloads necessitate the use of efficient specialized AI accelerators. However, the rapid changes in state-of-the-art AI algorithms as well as their varying compute and memory demands challenge accelerator deployments in datacenters as a result of the much slower hardware development cycle. To this end, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) offer the necessary adaptability along with the desired custom hardware efficiency. However, FPGA design is non-trivial; it requires deep hardware expertise and suffers from long compile and debug times, making FPGAs difficult to use for software-oriented AI application developers. AI inference soft processor overlays address this by allowing application developers to write their AI algorithms in a high-level programming language, which are then compiled into instructions to be executed on an AI-targeted soft processor implemented on the FPGA. While the generality of such overlays can eliminate the long bitstream compile times and make FPGAs more accessible for application developers, some classes of the target workloads do not fully utilize the overlay resources resulting in sub-optimal efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between hardware efficiency and designer productivity by quantifying the gains and costs of specializing overlays for different classes of AI workloads. We show that per-workload specialized variants of the neural processing unit (NPU), a state-of-the-art AI inference overlay, can achieve up to 41\% better performance and 44\% area savings.},

	abstract = {We present algorithms and an architectural methodology to enable zero skipping while increasing frequency in per-layer customized data flow Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) inference accelerators for FPGAs. Data flow architectures leverage the static configurability of FPGAs to increase processing efficiency, reduce dynamic muxing, and save routing wires. While this holds out the promise of high efficiency, these architectures require a different circuit to implement every CNN, making automated exploration and implementation of the accelerator essential. Each accelerator has layer-specific subcircuits with CNN-specific parallelization parameters and CNN graph topology-based interconnection that impact fanout and routing congestion, which lower the hardware operating frequency with naive implementation strategies. To address this, we designed latency insensitive hardware templates that build a model of signal fanout and span and instantiate different structures within each compute unit to ensure a high operating frequency regardless of CNN topology and parallelism settings. We also leverage the hardware efficiency of data flow architectures to add support for zero-weight-skipping at a normalized area cost less than one half of prior work. The overall optimization tool chooses parallelism settings for each layer-specific hardware unit to balance throughput across all layers of the CNN, while respecting the FPGA device limits on available buffering space and DSP blocks. Together these optimizations enable throughput on a sparse Resnet-50 model at a batch size of 1 of 4550 images/s, which is nearly 4x the throughput of NVIDIA's fastest machine learning targeted GPU, the V100, and outperforms all prior work on FPGAs.},

	abstract = {Object detection is an important computer vision task, with many applications in autonomous driving, smart surveillance, robotics, and other domains. Single-shot detectors (SSD) coupled with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction can efficiently detect, classify and localize various objects in an input image with very high accuracy. In such systems, the convolution layers extract features and predict the bounding box locations for the detected objects as well as their confidence scores. Then, a non-maximum suppression (NMS) algorithm eliminates partially overlapping boxes and selects the bounding box with the highest score per class. However, these two components are strictly sequential; a conventional NMS algorithm needs to wait for all box predictions to be produced before processing them. This prohibits any overlap between the execution of the convolutional layers and NMS, resulting in significant latency overhead and throughput degradation. In this paper, we present a novel NMS algorithm that alleviates this bottleneck and enables a fully-pipelined hardware implementation. We also implement an end-to-end system for low-latency SSD-MobileNet-V1 object detection, which combines a state-of-the-art deeply-pipelined CNN accelerator with a custom hardware implementation of our novel NMS algorithm. As a result of our new algorithm, the NMS module adds a minimal latency overhead of only 0.13μ s to the SSD-MobileNet-V1 convolution layers. Our end-to-end object detection system implemented on an Intel Stratix 10 FPGA runs at a maximum operating frequency of 350 MHz, with a throughput of 609 frames-per-second and an end-to-end batch-1 latency of 2.4 ms.

	abstract = {''Soft'' GPUs are overlays that implement GPGPU-like data parallel processor architectures in FPGA logic to make FPGAs as software-programmable as ''hard'' GPGPUs. Unlike hard GPUs, soft GPU architectures can be specialized to further improve efficiency by leveraging FPGA's flexibility. Prior work has shown the software programmability potential for soft GPUs but only studied general-purpose soft GPUs with minor specializations (e.g., FPGU, FlexGrip, MIAOW, and SCRATCH) or only domain-optimized for a particular application domain (e.g., PDL-FGPU for the persistent deep learning domain.) This paper proposes a soft GPU development framework to automate the creation of soft GPU instances with aggressive application-domain optimizations (i.e., domain-optimized GPUs, or DOGPUs) that consists of a baseline general soft GPU architecture ''template'' with an improved architecture over prior general purpose soft GPUs, along with a customizable partition that enables a custom datapath (macro unit) to be inserted to optimize for a target application domain. Unlike the prior PDL-FGPU which targets the persistent deep learning domain, the proposed framework can be used to target optimization for any application domain. Our evaluation on a set of data parallel workloads shows that (i) the proposed general soft GPU architecture offers average speedup of 1.8x versus the best prior soft GPUs we know of (i.e., FGPU, PDL-FGPU), (ii) DO-GPUs with domain-optimizations provide an average of 218x speedup over general soft GPUs, (iii) the proposed framework enabled building six new domain-optimized soft GPU instances in a matter of days, and (iv) enables quick GPU-like development effort (hours), where code is concise (low 100s of lines) and can be compiled in seconds without FPGA EDA tools in the loop, assuming an appropriate soft DO-GPU bitstream for the application domain is already built.},

@inproceedings{Boutros2020,
	abstract = {The growing importance and compute demands of artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the emergence of domain-optimized hardware platforms. For example, Nvidia GPUs introduced specialized tensor cores for matrix operations to speed up deep learning (DL) computation, resulting in very high peak throughput up to 130 int8 TOPS in the T4 GPU. Recently, Intel introduced its first AI-optimized 14nm FPGA, the Stratix 10 NX, with in-fabric AI tensor blocks that offer estimated peak performance up to 143 int8 TOPS, comparable to 12nm GPUs. However, what matters in practice is not the peak performance but the actual achievable performance on target workloads. This depends mainly on the utilization of the tensor units, and the system-level overheads to send data to/from the accelerator. This paper presents the first performance evaluation of Intel's AI-optimized FPGA, the Stratix 10 NX, in comparison to the latest accessible AI-optimized GPUs, the Nvidia T4 and V100, on a large suite of real-time DL inference workloads. We enhance a re-implementation of the Brainwave NPU overlay architecture to utilize the FPGA's AI tensor blocks, and develop toolchain support that allows users to program tensor blocks purely through software, without FPGA EDA tools in the loop. We first compare the Stratix 10 NX NPU against Stratix 10 GX/MX versions with no tensor blocks, and then present detailed core compute and system-level performance comparisons to the T4 and V100 GPUs. We show that our enhanced NPU on Stratix 10 NX achieves better tensor block utilization than GPUs, resulting in 24× and 12× average compute speedups over the T4 and V100 GPUs at batch-6. Even with relaxed latency constraints that allow a batch size of 32, we still achieve average speedups of 5× and 2× against T4 and V100 GPUs, respectively. On a system-level, the FPGA's fine-grained flexibility with its integrated 100 Gbps Ethernet allows for remote access at 10× and 2× less system overhead latency than local access to a V100 GPU via 128 Gbps PCIe for short and long sequence RNNs, respectively.},

	abstract = {With the continued growth in field-programmable gate array (FPGA) capacity and their incorporation into new environments such as datacenters, we have witnessed the introduction of a new class of reconfigurable acceleration devices (RADs) that go beyond conventional FPGA architectures. These devices combine a reconfigurable fabric with coarse-grained domain-specialized accelerator blocks all connected via a high-performance packet-switched network-on-chip (NoC) for efficient system-wide communication. However, we lack the tools necessary to efficiently explore the huge design space for RADs, study the complex interactions between their different components and evaluate various combinations of design choices. In this work, we develop RAD-Sim, a cycle-level architecture simulator that allows rapid application-driven exploration of the design space of novel RADs. To showcase the capabilities of RADSim, we map and simulate a state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) inference overlay on a RAD instance incorporating an FPGA fabric and a complex of hard matrix-vector multiplication engines, communicating over a system-wide NoC. Through this example, we show how RAD-Sim can help architects quantify the effect of changing specific architecture parameters on end-to-end application performance.},

	abstract = {The demand for computing performance is ever increasing. However, more computing performance often requires more power, which incurs increased monetary cost and environmental impact. Thus, power efficiency, i.e., performance-per-watt, is becoming more and more important.

Specialized hardware accelerators are the best known and most promising way to improve power efficiency. They improve power efficiency by reducing or eliminating wasted work. Some common ways to implement accelerators are configurable circuits (FPGAs), application-specific circuits (ASICs), and application-specific processors (ASPs). Though there have been several works comparing some of these implementation methods, none have accounted for system aspects, including how well an accelerator adapts to changes and overheads incurred to use the accelerator such as the cost of data movement.

This thesis provides a more comprehensive comparison of accelerators. Firstly, this thesis presents a metric to quantify how well an accelerator adapts to changes and uses that metric to analyze different accelerator implementation methods (accelerator classes.) Secondly, this thesis identifies the overheads of moving data to/from accelerators and evaluates how different overheads impact different accelerator classes. Finally, this thesis presents a design space explorer that automatically performs the analysis and determines which accelerator class is preferable and when.

Our results show that each accelerator class is preferable in certain, non-trivial cases. The cases where FPGA-based accelerators are preferable is larger than previously thought.},

Net-work nodes independently and randomly select linear mappings from inputs onto output links over some field. We show that this achieves optimal capacity with probability rapidly approaching 1 with the code length. We also demonstrate that randomized coding performs compression when necessary in a network, generalizing error exponents for linear Slepian-Wolf coding in a natural way. Benefits of this approach are decentralized operation and robustness to network changes or link failures. We show that this approach can take advantage of redundant network capacity for improved performance and robustness. We illustrate some potential advantages of randomized network coding over routing in two examples of practical scenarios: distributed network operation and online algorithms for networks with dynamically varying connections. Our mathematical development of these results also provides a link between network coding and network flows/bipartite match-ing, leading to a new bound on required field size for centralized network coding on general multicast networks.},

With systems based on the publish/subscribe interaction scheme, subscribers register their interest in an event, or a pattern of events, and are subsequently asynchronously notified of events generated by publishers. Many variants of the paradigm have recently been proposed, each variant being specifically adapted to some given application or network model. This paper factors out the common denominator underlying these variants: full decoupling of the communicating entities in time, space, and synchronization. We use these three decoupling dimensions to better identify commonalities and divergences with traditional interaction paradigms. The many variations on the theme of publish/subscribe are classified and synthesized. In particular, their respective benefits and shortcomings are discussed both in terms of interfaces and implementations.},

	abstract = {We present the Esterel programming language which is especially designed to program reactive systems, that is systems which maintain a permanent interaction with their environment: real-time process controllers, communication protocols, man-machine interface drivers, etc. Esterel is a deterministic concurrent programming language. It differs from classical asynchronous languages by its synchrony hypothesis: the outputs of a system are conceptually synchronous with its inputs. The synchrony hypothesis permits a high-level modular programming style simpler and more rigorous than its asynchronous counterpart. We present the imperative primitives of Eesterel and the temporal manipulations they permit. We give a small programming example. We present two mathematical semantics of Eesterel, which are given by conditional rewrite rules and related by a correctness theorem. The behavioral semantics defines the behavior of programs in an uneffective way as the solution of fixpoint equations. The effective execution semantics computes actions to be performed by a conceptually infinitely fast execution machine. To relate the two semantics, we solve the causality problems that are inherent in synchronous formalisms. We show how the Eesterel v2 and Eesterel v3 compilers efficiently translate concurrent Eesterel programs into efficient equivalent sequential automata that can be implemented in conventional sequential languages. We discuss the quality of this object code and the practical adequacy of the synchrony hypothesis.

	abstract = {All epistemic agents physically consist of parts that must somehow comprise an integrated cognitive self. Biological individuals consist of subunits (organs, cells, and molecular networks) that are themselves complex and competent in their own native contexts. How do coherent biological Individuals result from the activity of smaller sub-agents? To understand the evolution and function of metazoan creatures' bodies and minds, it is essential to conceptually explore the origin of multicellularity and the scaling of the basal cognition of individual cells into a coherent larger organism. In this article, I synthesize ideas in cognitive science, evolutionary biology, and developmental physiology toward a hypothesis about the origin of Individuality: ``Scale-Free Cognition.'' I propose a fundamental definition of an Individual based on the ability to pursue goals at an appropriate level of scale and organization and suggest a formalism for defining and comparing the cognitive capacities of highly diverse types of agents. Any Self is demarcated by a computational surface -- the spatio-temporal boundary of events that it can measure, model, and try to affect. This surface sets a functional boundary - a cognitive ``light cone'' which defines the scale and limits of its cognition. I hypothesize that higher level goal-directed activity and agency, resulting in larger cognitive boundaries, evolve from the primal homeostatic drive of living things to reduce stress -- the difference between current conditions and life-optimal conditions. The mechanisms of developmental bioelectricity - the ability of all cells to form electrical networks that process information - suggest a plausible set of gradual evolutionary steps that naturally lead from physiological homeostasis in single cells to memory, prediction, and ultimately complex cognitive agents, via scale-up of the basic drive of infotaxis. Recent data on the molecular mechanisms of pre-neural bioelectricity suggest a model of how increasingly sophisticated cognitive functions emerge smoothly from cell-cell communication used to guide embryogenesis and regeneration. This set of hypotheses provides a novel perspective on numerous phenomena, such as cancer, and makes several unique, testable predictions for interdisciplinary research that have implications not only for evolutionary developmental biology but also for biomedicine and perhaps artificial intelligence and exobiology.},

	abstract = {The actor model of computation has gained significant popularity over the last decade. Its high level of abstraction makes it appealing for concurrent applications in parallel and distributed systems. However, designing a real-world actor framework that subsumes full scalability, strong reliability, and high resource efficiency requires many conceptual and algorithmic additives to the original model. In this paper, we report on designing and building CAF, the C++ Actor Framework. CAF targets at providing a concurrent and distributed native environment for scaling up to very large, high-performance applications, and equally well down to small constrained systems. We present the key specifications and design concepts---in particular a message-transparent architecture, type-safe message interfaces, and pattern matching facilities---that make native actors a viable approach for many robust, elastic, and highly distributed developments. We demonstrate the feasibility of CAF in three scenarios: first for elastic, upscaling environments, second for including heterogeneous hardware like GPGPUs, and third for distributed runtime systems. Extensive performance evaluations indicate ideal runtime behaviour for up to 64 cores at very low memory footprint, or in the presence of GPUs. In these tests, CAF continuously outperforms the competing actor environments Erlang, Charm++, SalsaLite, Scala, ActorFoundry, and even the OpenMPI.},

Our goal in this paper is to consider how quality of service (QoS) may be monitored at such TONs. The question is particularly important as access to WDM networks, and associated security concerns, increase. Our paper has four parts. First, we present an overview of the vulnerabilities of TONs to QoS degradation for two main classes of TONs, namely alloptical switching nodes and amplifiers in optical networks. Second, we discuss the applicability of traditional supervisory methods to such degradations. Third, we propose a novel approach to monitoring QoS degradations in TONs. Our approach works by comparing the input and output at a node and deciding whether unacceptable service degradation has occurred at that node. Finally, we analyze the performance, under simple attack scenarios, of our approach for jamming attacks at transparent optical switching nodes and amplifiers. We show that our method is several orders of magnitude faster than bit error rate testers in detecting QoS degradations.},

We find that, while minimum-cost routing problems without network coding are very difficult except in the special case of unicast, minimum-cost routing of single multicast connections with network coding can be posed as a linear optimization problem that admits a distributed solution. In particular, we apply our approach to the problem of minimum-energy multicast in wireless networks with omnidirectional antennas and show that it can be handled by a linear optimization problem with a distributed solution when network coding is used. In the case of multiple multicast connections, we give a partial solution: We specify a linear optimization problem that yields a solution of no greater cost than any solution without network coding and that we suspect can potentially be substantially better.},

@article{Sundararajan2011,
	abstract = {The theory of network coding promises significant benefits in network performance, especially in lossy networks and in multicast and multipath scenarios. To realize these benefits in practice, we need to understand how coding across packets interacts with the acknowledgment (ACK)-based flow control mechanism that forms a central part of today's Internet protocols such as transmission control protocol (TCP). Current approaches such as rateless codes and batch-based coding are not compatible with TCP's retransmission and sliding-window mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism called TCP/NC that incorporates network coding into TCP with only minor changes to the protocol stack, thereby allowing incremental deployment. In our scheme, the source transmits random linear combinations of packets currently in the congestion window. At the heart of our scheme is a new interpretation of ACKs-the sink acknowledges every degree of freedom (i.e., a linear combination that reveals one unit of new information) even if it does not reveal an original packet immediately. Thus, our new TCP ACK rule takes into account the network coding operations in the lower layer and enables a TCP-compatible sliding-window approach to network coding. Coding essentially masks losses from the congestion control algorithm and allows TCP/NC to react smoothly to losses, resulting in a novel and effective approach for congestion control over lossy networks such as wireless networks. An important feature of our solution is that it allows intermediate nodes to perform re-encoding of packets, which is known to provide significant throughput gains in lossy networks and multicast scenarios. Simulations show that our scheme, with or without re-encoding inside the network, achieves much higher throughput compared to TCP over lossy wireless links. We present a real-world implementation of this protocol that addresses the practical aspects of incorporating network coding and decoding with TCP's wind ow management mechanism. We work with TCP-Reno, which is a widespread and practical variant of TCP. Our implementation significantly advances the goal of designing a deployable, general, TCP-compatible protocol that provides the benefits of network coding.},

Network coding moves away from the classical approach of networking, which treats networks as akin to physical transportation systems. We overview some of the main features of network coding that are most relevant to wireless networks. In particular, we discuss the fact that random distributed network coding is asymptotically optimal for wireless networks with and without packet erasures. These results are extremely general and allow packet loss correlation, such as may occur in fading wireless channels. The coded network lends itself, for multicast connections, to a cost optimization which not only outperforms traditional routing tree-based approaches, but also lends itself to a distributed implementation and to a dynamic implementation when changing conditions, such as mobility, arise. We illustrate the performance of such optimization methods for energy efficiency in wireless networks and propose some new directions for research in the area.},

This simple, unifying framework allows us to re-establish with economy the optimality of linear codes for single transmitter channels and for Slepian-Wolf source coding. It also enables us to establish the optimality of linear codes for multiple access channels and for erasure broadcast channels. Moreover, we show that source-channel separation holds for these networks. This robustness of separation we show to be strongly predicated on the fact that noise and inputs are independent. The linearity of source, channel, and network coding blurs the delineation between these codes, and thus we explore joint linear de-sign. Finally, we illustrate the fact that design for individual network modules may yield poor results when such modules are concatenated, demonstrating that end-to-end coding is necessary. Thus, we argue, it is the lack of decom-posability into canonical network modules, rather than the lack of separation between source and channel coding, that presents major challenges for coding in networks.},

@article{Lee1995,
	abstract = {We review a model of computation used in industrial practice in signal processing software environments and experimentally and other contexts. We give this model the name dataflow process networks, and study its formal properties as well as its utility as a basis for programming language design. Variants of this model are used in commercial visual programming systems such as SPW from the Alta Group of Cadence (formerly Comdisco Systems), COSSAP from Synopsys (formerly Cadis), the DSP Station from Mentor Graphics, and Hypersignal from Hyperception. They are also used in research software such as Khoros from the University of New Mexico and Ptolemy from the University of California at Berkeley, among many others. Dataflow process networks are shown to be a special case of Kahn process networks, a model of computation where a number of concurrent processes communicate through unidirectional FIFO channels, where writes to the channel are nonblocking, and reads are blocking. In dataflow process networks, each process consists of repeated  firings  of a dataflow  actor.  An actor defines a (often functional) quantum of computation. By dividing processes into actor firings, the considerable overhead of context switching incurred in most implementations of Kahn process networks is avoided. We relate dataflow process networks to other dataflow models, including those used in dataflow machines, such as static dataflow and the tagged-token model. We also relate dataflow process networks to functional languages such as Haskell, and show that modern language concepts such as higher-order functions and polymorphism can be used effectively in dataflow process networks. A number of programming examples using a visual syntax are given.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

Here we present a general method for inferring direct effects from an observed correlation matrix containing both direct and indirect effects. We formulate the problem as the inverse of network convolution, and introduce an algorithm that removes the combined effect of all indirect paths of arbitrary length in a closed-form solution by exploiting eigen-decomposition and infinite-series sums. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in several network applications: distinguishing direct targets in gene expression regulatory networks; recognizing directly interacting amino-acid residues for protein structure prediction from sequence alignments; and distinguishing strong collaborations in co-authorship social networks using connectivity information alone. In addition to its theoretical impact as a foundational graph theoretic tool, our results suggest network deconvolution is widely applicable for computing direct dependencies in network science across diverse disciplines.},

The approach is to express the input process as an expansion in an orthonormal set of functions each localized in time and frequency. The fourth moment of each coefficient in this expansion is then uniformly constrained. We show that such a constraint forces the mutual information to 0 inversely with increasing bandwidth. Simply constraining the second moment of these coefficients does not achieve this effect. The results suggest strongly that conventional
direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems do not scale well to extremely large bandwidths. To illustrate how the

@book{Price1997,
	abstract = {Why is the future so different from the past? Why does the past affect the future and not the other way around? What does quantum mechanics really tell us about the world? In this important and accessible book, Huw Price throws fascinating new light on some of the great mysteries of modern physics, and connects them in a wholly original way. Price begins with the mystery of the arrow of time. Why, for example, does disorder always increase, as required by the second law of thermodynamics? Price shows that, for over a century, most physicists have thought about these problems the wrong way. Misled by the human perspective from within time, which distorts and exaggerates the differences between past and future, they have fallen victim to what Price calls the double standard fallacy: proposed explanations of the difference between the past and the future turn out to rely on a difference which has been slipped in at the beginning, when the physicists themselves treat the past and future in different ways. To avoid this fallacy, Price argues, we need to overcome our natural tendency to think about the past and the future differently. We need to imagine a point outside time -- an Archimedean  view from nowhen -- from which to observe time in an unbiased way. Offering a lively criticism of many major modern physicists, including Richard Feynman and Stephen Hawking, Price shows that this fallacy remains common in physics today -- for example, when contemporary cosmologists theorize about the eventual fate of the universe. The  big bang  theory normally assumes that the beginning and end of the universe will be very different. But if we are to avoid the double standard fallacy, we need to consider time symmetrically, and take seriously the possibility that the arrow of time may reverse when the universe recollapses into a  big crunch.  Price then turns to the greatest mystery of modern physics, the meaning of quantum theory. He argues that in missing the Archimedean viewpoint, modern physics has missed a radical and attractive solution to many of the apparent paradoxes of quantum physics. Many consequences of quantum theory appear counterintuitive, such as Schrodinger's Cat, whose condition seems undetermined until observed, and Bell's Theorem, which suggests a spooky nonlocality,where events happening simultaneously in different places seem to affect each other directly. Price shows that these paradoxes can be avoided by allowing that at the quantum level the future does, indeed, affect the past. This demystifies nonlocality, and supports Einstein's unpopular intuition that quantum theory describes an objective world, existing independently of human observers: the Cat is alive or dead, even when nobody looks. So interpreted, Price argues, quantum mechanics is simply the kind of theory we ought to have expectedin microphysics -- from the symmetric standpoint.Time's Arrow and Archimedes' Point presents an innovative and controversial view of time and contemporary physics. In this exciting book, Price urges physicists, philosophers, and anyone who has ever pondered the mysteries of time to look at the world from the fresh perspective of Archimedes' Point and gain a deeper understanding of ourselves, the universe around us, and our own place in time.},

In addition, it can adapt to any arbitrary network topology and power constraint.

@book{Liu2006,

They consist of concurrent components that communicate using timed signals, that is, sets of (semantically) time-stamped events. The denotational semantics of such systems is traditionally formulated in a metric space, wherein causal components are modeled as contracting functions. We show that this formulation excessively restricts the models of time that can be used. In particular, it cannot handle super-dense time, commonly used in hardware description languages and hybrid systems modeling, finite time lines, and time with no origin. Moreover, if we admit continuous- time and mixed signals (essential for hybrid systems modeling) or certain Zeno signals, then causality is no longer equivalent to its formalization in terms of contracting functions. In this paper, we oer an alternative semantic framework using a generalized ultrametric that overcomes these limitations.},

Time moves forward, not backward---everyone knows you can't unscramble an egg. In the hands of one of today's hottest young physicists, that simple fact of breakfast becomes a doorway to understanding the Big Bang, the universe, and other universes, too. In From Eternity to Here, Sean Carroll argues that the arrow of time, pointing resolutely from the past to the future, owes its existence to conditions before the Big Bang itself--- a period modern cosmology of which Einstein never dreamed. Increasingly, though, physicists are going out into realms that make the theory of relativity seem like child's play. Carroll's scenario is not only elegant, it's laid out in the same easy-to- understand language that has made his group blog, Cosmic Variance, the most popular physics blog on the Net. From Eternity to Here uses ideas at the cutting edge of theoretical physics to explore how properties of spacetime before the Big Bang can explain the flow of time we experience in our everyday lives. Carroll suggests that we live in a baby universe, part of a large family of universes in which many of our siblings experience an arrow of time running in the opposite direction. It's an ambitious, fascinating picture of the universe on an ultra-large scale, one that will captivate fans of popular physics blockbusters like Elegant Universe and A Brief History of Time.

	abstract = {We examine the issue of separation and code design for network data transmission environments. We demonstrate that source-channel separation holds for several canonical network channel models when the whole network operates over a common finite field. Our approach uses linear codes. This simple, unifying framework allows us to re-establish with economy the optimality of linear codes for single transmitter channels and for Slepian-Wolf source coding. It also enables us to establish the optimality of linear codes for multiple access channels and for erasure broadcast channels. Moreover, we show that source-channel separation holds for these networks. This robustness of separation we show to be strongly predicated on the fact that noise and inputs are independent. The linearity of source, channel, and network coding blurs the delineation between these codes, and thus we explore joint linear design. Finally, we illustrate the fact that design for individual network modules may yield poor results when such modules are concatenated, demonstrating that end-to-end coding is necessary. Thus, we argue, it is the lack of decomposability into canonical network modules, rather than the lack of separation between source and channel coding, that presents major challenges for coding in networks.},

	abstract = {Dataflow models of computation have intrigued computer scientists since the 1970s. They were first introduced by Jack Dennis as a basis for parallel programming languages and architectures, and by Gilles Kahn as a model of concurrency. Interest in these models of computation has been recently rekindled by the resurrection of parallel computing, due to the emergence of multicore architectures. However, Dennis and Kahn approached dataflow very differently. Dennis' approach was based on an operational notion of atomic firings driven by certain firing rules. Kahn's approach was based on a denotational notion of processes as continuous functions on infinite streams. This paper bridges the gap between these two points of view, showing that sequences of firings define a continuous Kahn process as the least fixed point of an appropriately constructed functional. The Dennis firing rules are sets of finite prefixes satisfying certain conditions that ensure determinacy. These conditions result in firing rules that are strictly more general than the blocking reads of the Kahn-MacQueen implementation of Kahn process networks, and solve some compositionality problems in the dataflow model.},

However, the conceptof measurement by which probabilities are introduced instandard quantum theory no longer plays a fundamentalrole. Instead, all quantum time dependence is probabilistic(stochastic), with probabilities given by the Born rule or itsextensions. By requiring that the description of a quantum system becarried out using a well-defined probabilistic sample space (called a``framework'') this approach resolves all the well-knownquantum paradoxes of quantum foundations. In particular, quantummechanics is local and consistent with special relativity. Classicalmechanics emerges as a useful approximation to the more fundamentalquantum mechanics under suitable conditions. The price to be paid forthis is a set of rules for reasoning resembling, but alsosignificantly different from, those which comprise quantum logic. Animportant philosophical implication is the lack of a singleuniversally-true state of affairs at each instant of time. However,there is a correspondence limit in which the new quantum logic becomesstandard logic in the macroscopic world of everyday experience., In the article that follows the term `consistenthistories' will generally be abbreviated to`histories', since the `decoherent' and`consistent' interpretations are very similar; when indoubt insert `consistent' before`histories'.

The discussion then builds on these basics to illustrate recovery schemes for high-speed backbone networks. An examination of the relationship between network topologies and recovery strategies follows, beginning with rings and then covering more general mesh networks. We cover some basic techniques used in packet-switched networks, and conclude with a discussion of local-area network approaches to fault tolerance.

	abstract = {Remote procedure call is the synchronous language-level transfer of control between programs in disjoint address spaces whose primary communication medium is a narrow channel. The thesis of this dissertation is that remote procedure call (RPC) is a satisfactory and efficient programming language primitive for constructing distributed systems. 
A survey of existing remote procedure mechanisms shows that past RPC efforts are weak in addressing the five crucial issues: uniform call semantics, binding and configuration, strong typechecking, parameter functionality, and concurrency and exception control. The body of the dissertation elaborates these issues and defines a set of corresponding essential properties for RPC mechanisms. These properties must be satisfied by any RPC mechanism that is fully and uniformly integrated into a programming language for a homogeneous distributed system. Uniform integration is necessary to meet the dissertation's fundamental goal of syntactic and semantic transparency for local and remote procedures. Transparency is important so that programmers need not concern themselves with the physical distribution of their programs. 
In addition to these essential language properties, a number of pleasant properties are introduced that ease the work of distributed programming. These pleasant properties are good performance, sound remote interface design, atomic transactions, respect for autonomy, type translation, and remote debugging. 
With the essential and pleasant properties broadly explored, the detailed design of an RPC mechanism that satisfies all of the essential properties and the performance property is presented. Two design approaches are used: The first assumes full programming language support and involves changes to the language's compiler and binder. The second involves no language changes, but uses a separate translator--a source-to-source RPC compiler--to implement the same functionality. 
Design decisions crucial to the efficiency of the mechanism are made using a set of RPC performance lessons. These lessons are based on the empirical performance evaluation of a sequence of five working RPC mechanisms, each one faster than its predecessor. Some expected results about the costs of parameter copying, process switching, and runtime type manipulation are confirmed; a surprising result about the price of protocol layering is presented as well. These performance lessons, applied in concert, reduce the roundtrip time for a remote procedure call by a remarkable factor of 35. For moderate speed personal computers communicating over an Ethernet, for example, a simple remote call takes 800 microseconds; on a higher speed personal computer, the same remote call takes 149 microseconds. In both cases the remote call takes about 20 times longer than the same local call. This represents a substantial performance improvement over other operational RPC mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Bugs in multi-threaded programs often arise due to data races. Numerous static and dynamic program analysis techniques have been proposed to detect data races. We propose a novel randomized dynamic analysis technique that utilizes potential data race information obtained from an existing analysis tool to separate real races from false races without any need for manual inspection. Specifically, we use potential data race information obtained from an existing dynamic analysis technique to control a random scheduler of threads so that real race conditions get created with very high probability and those races get resolved randomly at runtime. Our approach has several advantages over existing dynamic analysis tools. First, we can create a real race condition and resolve the race randomly to see if an error can occur due to the race. Second, we can replay a race revealing execution efficiently by simply using the same seed for random number generation--we do not need to record the execution. Third, our approach has very low overhead compared to other precise dynamic race detection techniques because we only track all synchronization operations and a single pair of memory access statements that are reported to be in a potential race by an existing analysis. We have implemented the technique in a prototype tool for Java and have experimented on a number of large multi-threaded Java programs. We report a number of previously known and unknown bugs and real races in these Java programs.},

They referred to this as pragmatics, and argued that a key enabler would be the ability to automatically synthesize customized graphical views from a (possibly textual) model. The model would be the ``ground truth'' used, for example, for downstream code synthesis and simulation; the graphical views would typically be abstractions from the model serving various purposes, including documentation. Twelve years later, we reflect on their proposal, and illustrate the current state with the recently developed polyglot coordination language Lingua Franca (LF). LF has been designed with pragmatics in mind since early on, and some characteristics of LF make it particularly suited for pragmatics-aware programming and modeling. However, the underlying pragmatic principles are broadly applicable, and by now a set of mature open source tools is available for putting them into practice.},

	abstract = {Signal processing and multimedia applications are often implemented on resource constrained embedded systems. It is therefore important to find implementations that use as little resources as possible. These applications are frequently specified as synchronous dataflow graphs. Communication between actors of these graphs requires storage capacity. In this paper, we present an exact method to determine the minimum storage capacity required to execute the graph using model-checking techniques. This can be done for different measures of storage capacity. The problem is known to be NP-complete and because of this, existing buffer minimisation techniques are heuristics and hence not exact. Modern model-checking tools are quite efficient and they have been successfully applied to scheduling-related problems. We study the feasibility of this approach with examples.},

The fundamental abstraction for visualization in iDeA is a concurrent trace: a partially ordered sequence of asynchronous messages exchanged in the execution. iDeA provides a 3D interface in virtual reality for users to visualize and manipulate program traces: users can set breakpoints, query actor state, step through traces forward and backward, and perform causal history of messages in a trace. While the modularity of iDeA enables debugging any actor program provided that the program events are collected and communicated to the visualization end, our implementation of iDeA targets actor programs written in Akka framework in Scala.},

To ensure high performance under a wide variety of conditions, the ordering of synch operations is based on a deterministic clock [25], and store buffering is implemented using version-controlled memory [23]. Recent work on deterministic concurrency [14, 19] has proposed relaxing the consistency model beyond total store order (TSO). Through novel optimizations, Consequence achieves the same or better performance on the Phoenix, PARSEC and SPLASH-2 benchmark suites, while retaining TSO memory consistency. Across 19 benchmark programs, Consequence incurs a worst-case slowdown of 3.9× vs. pthreads, with 14 out of 19 programs at or below 2.5×. We believe this performance improvement takes parallel programming one step closer to determinism by default.},

	abstract = {Fran (Functional Reactive Animation) is a collection of data types and functions for composing richly interactive, multimedia animations. The key ideas in Fran are its notions of behaviors and events. Behaviors are time-varying, reactive values, while events are sets of arbitrarily complex conditions, carrying possibly rich information. Most traditional values can be treated as behaviors, and when images are thus treated, they become animations. Although these notions are captured as data types rather than a programming language, we provide them with a denotational semantics, including a proper treatment of real time, to guide reasoning and implementation. A method to effectively and efficiently perform event detection using interval analysis is also described, which relies on the partial information structure on the domain of event times. Fran has been implemented in Hugs, yielding surprisingly good performance for an interpreter-based system. Several examples are given, including the ability to describe physical phenomena involving gravity, springs, velocity, acceleration, etc. using ordinary differential equations.},

Random graphs and lattices represent two limiting kinds of agent interaction networks studied, with so-called 'small-world' networks being an intermediate form between these two extremes. A model of retirement behavior is studied with each network type, resulting in important differences in key model outputs. Then, in the context of a model of multi-agent firm formation it is demonstrated that the medium of interaction--whether through individual agents or through firms--affects the qualitative character of the results. Finally, alternative agent activation 'schedules' are studied. In particular, two activation modes are compared: (1) all agents being active exactly once each period, and (2) each agent having a random number of activations per period with mean 1. In some models these two regimes produce indistinguishable results at the aggregate level, but in certain cases the differences between them are significant.},

	abstract = {Multithreaded programming is notoriously difficult to get right. A key problem is non-determinism, which complicates debugging, testing, and reproducing errors. One way to simplify multithreaded programming is to enforce deterministic execution, but current deterministic systems for C/C++ are incomplete or impractical. These systems require program modification, do not ensure determinism in the presence of data races, do not work with general-purpose multithreaded programs, or run up to 8.4× slower than pthreads. This paper presents Dthreads, an efficient deterministic multithreading system for unmodified C/C++ applications that replaces the pthreads library. Dthreads enforces determinism in the face of data races and deadlocks. Dthreads works by exploding multithreaded applications into multiple processes, with private, copy-on-write mappings to shared memory. It uses standard virtual memory protection to track writes, and deterministically orders updates by each thread. By separating updates from different threads, Dthreads has the additional benefit of eliminating false sharing. Experimental results show that Dthreads substantially outperforms a state-of-the-art deterministic runtime system, and for a majority of the benchmarks evaluated here, matches and occasionally exceeds the performance of pthreads.},

The goal is to recover the clusters with minimum number of such queries. This problem has been of recent interest for the case of disjoint clusters. In this paper, we look at the more practical scenario of overlapping clusters, and provide upper bounds (with algorithms) on the sufficient number of queries. We provide algorithmic results under both arbitrary (worst-case) and statistical modeling assumptions. Our algorithms are parameter free, efficient, and work in the presence of random noise. We also derive information-theoretic lower bounds on the number of queries needed, proving that our algorithms are order optimal.

We find that Einstein's procedure for an inertial observer to assign coordinates to distant events becomes ambiguous for sufficiently distant events. The accuracy to which two clocks can be synchronized turns out to depend on the distance between them. These are consequences of the non-commutativity of space and time coordinates or a dependence of the speed of light on energy in relativistic theories. These ambiguities grow with distance and only become relevant for real observations for the description of cosmologically distant events. They do not afflict the interpretation of the detection of gamma rays in stationary or moving frames near the detector. Consequently there is no disagreement between the principles of DSR and the observation that interactions in nature are local down to currently observable scales.},

	abstract = {Balancing the needs of data privacy and predictive utility is a central challenge for machine learning in healthcare. In particular, privacy concerns have led to a dearth of public datasets, complicated the construction of multi-hospital cohorts and limited the utilization of external machine learning resources. To remedy this, new methods are required to enable data owners, such as hospitals, to share their datasets publicly, while preserving both patient privacy and modeling utility. We propose NeuraCrypt, a private encoding scheme based on random deep neural networks. NeuraCrypt encodes raw patient data using a randomly constructed neural network known only to the data-owner, and publishes both the encoded data and associated labels publicly. From a theoretical perspective, we demonstrate that sampling from a sufficiently rich family of encoding functions offers a well-defined and meaningful notion of privacy against a computationally unbounded adversary with full knowledge of the underlying data-distribution. We propose to approximate this family of encoding functions through random deep neural networks. Empirically, we demonstrate the robustness of our encoding to a suite of adversarial attacks and show that NeuraCrypt achieves competitive accuracy to non-private baselines on a variety of x-ray tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that multiple hospitals, using independent private encoders, can collaborate to train improved x-ray models. Finally, we release a challenge dataset to encourage the development of new attacks on NeuraCrypt.},

	abstract = {The conceptual definition and understanding of the nature of time, both qualitatively and quantitatively is of the utmost difficulty and importance, and plays a fundamental role in physics. Physical systems seem to evolve in paths of increasing entropy and of complexity, and thus, the arrow of time shall be explored in the context of thermodynamic irreversibility and quantum physics. In Newtonian physics, time flows at a constant rate, the same for all observers; however, it necessarily flows at different rates for different observers in special and general relativity. Special relativity provides important quantitative elucidations of the fundamental processes related to time dilation effects, and general relativity provides a deep analysis to effects of time flow, such as in the presence of gravitational fields. Through the special theory of relativity, time became intimately related with space, giving rise to the notion of spacetime, in which both parameters cannot be considered as separate entities. As time is incorporated into the proper structure of the fabric of spacetime, it is interesting to note that general relativity is contaminated with non-trivial geometries that generate closed timelike curves, and thus apparently violates causality. The notion of causality is fundamental in the construction of physical theories; therefore time travel and its associated paradoxes have to be treated with great caution. These issues are briefly analyzed in this review paper.},

	abstract = {We design a cross-layer approach to aid in develop- ing a cooperative solution using multi-packet reception (MPR), network coding (NC), and medium access (MAC). We construct a model for the behavior of the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol and apply it to key small canonical topology components and their larger counterparts. The results obtained from this model match the available experimental results with fidelity. Using this model, we show that fairness allocation by the IEEE 802.11 MAC can significantly impede performance; hence, we devise a new MAC that not only substantially improves throughput, but provides fairness to flows of information rather than to nodes. We show that cooperation between NC, MPR, and our new MAC achieves super-additive gains of up to 6.3 times that of routing with the standard IEEE 802.11 MAC. Furthermore, we extend the model to analyze our MAC's asymptotic and throughput behaviors as the number of nodes increases or the MPR capability is limited to only a single node. Finally, we show that although network performance is reduced under substantial asymmetry or limited implementation of MPR to a central node, there are some important practical cases, even under these conditions, where MPR, NC, and their combination provide significant gains.},

	abstract = {Dual-unitary brickwork circuits are an exactly-solvable model for many-body chaotic quantum systems, based on 2-site gates which are unitary in both the time and space directions. Prosen has recently described an alternative model called 'dual-unitary interactions round-a-face', which we here call 'clockwork', based on 2-controlled 1-site unitaries composed in a non-brickwork structure, yet with many of the same attractive global properties. We present a 2-categorical framework that simultaneously generalizes these two existing models, and use it to show that brickwork and clockwork circuits can interact richly, yielding new types of generalized heterogeneous circuits. We show that these interactions are governed by quantum combinatorial data, which we precisely characterize. These generalized circuits remain exactly-solvable and we show that they retain the attractive features of the original models such as single-site correlation functions vanishing everywhere except on the causal light-cone. Our presented framework allows us to directly extend the notion of solvable initial states to these biunitary circuits, which are shown to result in maximal entanglement growth and exact thermalization after finitely many time steps under biunitary circuit dynamics.},

@misc{Michel2022,
	abstract = {Packet losses are common events in today's networks. They usually result in longer delivery times for application data since retransmissions are the de facto technique to recover from such losses. Retransmissions is a good strategy for many applications but it may lead to poor performance with latency-sensitive applications compared to network coding. Although different types of network coding techniques have been proposed to reduce the impact of losses by transmitting redundant information, they are not widely used. Some niche applications include their own variant of Forward Erasure Correction (FEC) techniques, but there is no generic protocol that enables many applications to easily use them. We close this gap by designing, implementing and evaluating a new Flexible Erasure Correction (FlEC) framework inside the newly standardized QUIC protocol. With FlEC, an application can easily select the reliability mechanism that meets its requirements, from pure retransmissions to various forms of FEC. We consider three different use cases: \$(i)\$ bulk data transfer, \$(ii)\$ file transfers with restricted buffers and \$(iii)\$ delay-constrained messages. We demonstrate that modern transport protocols such as QUIC may benefit from application knowledge by leveraging this knowledge in FlEC to provide better loss recovery and stream scheduling. Our evaluation over a wide range of scenarios shows that the FlEC framework outperforms the standard QUIC reliability mechanisms from a latency viewpoint.},

In particular, almost all real-world computers are  periodic  in that they iteratively apply the same physical process, and are local in that not all physical variables that are statistically coupled are also physically coupled. Here we investigate the nonzero EP that necessarily results from these constraints in deterministic finite automata (DFA), a foundational system of computer science theory. First we derive expressions for the minimal EP due to implementing a DFA with a periodic, local physical process. We then relate these costs to the computational characteristics of the DFA. Specifically, we show that these costs divide regular languages into two classes: those with an invertible local update map, which have zero minimal cost, and those with a non-invertible local update map, which have high cost. We also demonstrate the thermodynamic advantages of implementing a DFA with a physical process that is agnostic about which inputs it will receive.},

This semantics justifies a rich set of subtyping rules for an equirecursive variant of call-by-push-value, including variant and lazy records. We further present a bidirectional syntactic typing system for both values and computations that elegantly and pragmatically circumvents difficulties of type inference in the presence of width and depth subtyping for variant and lazy records. We demonstrate the flexibility of our system by systematically deriving related systems of subtyping for (a) isorecursive types, (b) call-by-name, and (c) call-by-value, all using a structural rather than a nominal interpretation of types.},

Central to any compositional theory of interaction is the dichotomy between a system and its environment. Concurrent games and strategies address the dichotomy in fine detail, very locally, in a distributed fashion, through distinctions between Player moves (events of the system) and Opponent moves (those of the environment). A functional approach has to handle the dichotomy much more ingeniously, through its blunter distinction between input and output. This has led to a variety of functional approaches, specialised to particular interactive demands.

	abstract = {A concurrent object is a data object shared by concurrent processes. Linearizability is a correctness condition for concurrent objects that exploits the semantics of abstract data types. It permits a high degree of concurrency, yet it permits programmers to specify and reason about concurrent objects using known techniques from the sequential domain. Linearizability provides the illusion that each operation applied by concurrent processes takes effect instantaneously at some point between its invocation and its response, implying that the meaning of a concurrent object's operations can be given by pre- and post-conditions. This paper defines linearizability, compares it to other correctness conditions, presents and demonstrates a method for proving the correctness of implementations, and shows how to reason about concurrent objects, given they are linearizable.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this book is to help you program shared-memory parallel systems without risking your sanity. Nevertheless, you should think of the information in this book as a foundation on which to build, rather than as a completed cathedral. Your mission, if you choose to accept, is to help make further progress in the exciting field of parallel programming-progress that will in time render this book obsolete. Parallel programming in the 21st century is no longer focused solely on science, research, and grand-challenge projects. And this is all to the good, because it means that parallel programming is becoming an engineering discipline. Therefore, as befits an engineering discipline, this book examines specific parallel-programming tasks and describes how to approach them. In some surprisingly common cases, these tasks can be automated. This book is written in the hope that presenting the engineering discipline underlying successful parallel-programming projects will free a new generation of parallel hackers from the need to slowly and painstakingly reinvent old wheels, enabling them to instead focus their energy and creativity on new frontiers. However, what you get from this book will be determined by what you put into it. It is hoped that simply reading this book will be helpful, and that working the Quick Quizzes will be even more helpful. However, the best results come from applying the techniques taught in this book to real-life problems. As always, practice makes perfect. But no matter how you approach it, we sincerely hope that parallel programming brings you at least as much fun, excitement, and challenge that it has brought to us!},

	abstract = {We introduce a framework designed to analyze the thermodynamics of an abstractly defined logical computer like a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) or a Turing machine, without specifying any extraneous parameters (like rate matrices, Hamiltonians, etc.) of a physical process that implements the computer. Earlier investigations of how to do this were based on the continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) formulation of stochastic thermodynamics. These investigations either assumed that there was exactly zero irreversible entropy production (EP) generated by the physical system implementing the computation, or allowed the EP to be nonzero but only considered the mismatch cost component of the EP. In addition, they only applied to a single type of computer. Our framework neither requires that EP equal zero nor restricts attention to the mismatch cost component of EP, and is designed to apply to all types of computational machines. In contrast to earlier investigations using the CTMC-based formulation, our framework is based on the inclusive Hamiltonian formulation, in which the combination of the system of interest and the baths evolve in a Hamiltonian (or unitary) dynamics. Here, we use our framework to derive an integral fluctuation theorem for computers, in which the expectation value is strictly less than 1. We also derive an exchange fluctuation theorem, and a mismatch cost formula involving first-passage times. We analyze the EP generated by a DFA, a Markov information source, and a noisy communication channel. In particular, we use the Myhill-Nerode theorem of computer science to prove that out of all DFAs which recognize the same language, the minimal complexity DFA is the one with minimal EP for all dynamics and at all iterations.},

	abstract = {Actor frameworks and similar reactive programming techniques are widely used for building concurrent systems. They promise to be efficient and scale well to a large number of cores or nodes in a distributed system. However, they also expose programmers to nondeterminism, which often makes implementations hard to understand, debug, and test. The recently proposed reactor model is a promising alternative that enables efficient deterministic concurrency. In this paper, we show that determinacy does neither imply a loss in expressivity nor in performance. To show this, we evaluate Lingua Franca (LF), a reactor-oriented coordination language that equips mainstream programming languages with a concurrency model that automatically takes advantage of opportunities to exploit parallelism that do not introduce nondeterminism. Our implementation of the Savina benchmark suite demonstrates that, in terms of execution time, the runtime performance of LF programs even exceeds popular and highly optimized actor frameworks. We compare against Akka and CAF, which LF outperforms by 1.86x and 1.42x, respectively.},

	abstract = {Dual-unitary brickwork circuits are an exactly-solvable model for many-body chaotic quantum systems, based on 2-site gates which are unitary in both the time and space directions. Prosen has recently described an alternative model called 'dual-unitary interactions round-a-face', which we here call 'clockwork', based on 2-controlled 1-site unitaries composed in a non-brickwork structure, yet with many of the same attractive global properties. We present a 2-categorical framework that simultaneously generalizes these two existing models, and use it to show that brickwork and clockwork circuits can interact richly, yielding new types of generalized heterogeneous circuits. We show that these interactions are governed by quantum combinatorial data, which we precisely characterize. These generalized circuits remain exactly-solvable and we show that they retain the attractive features of the original models such as single-site correlation functions vanishing everywhere except on the causal light-cone. Our presented framework allows us to directly extend the notion of solvable initial states to these biunitary circuits, which are shown to result in maximal entanglement growth and exact thermalization after finitely many time steps under biunitary circuit dynamics.},

@misc{Bradley2020a,
	abstract = {This thesis takes inspiration from quantum physics to investigate mathematical structure that lies at the interface of algebra and statistics. The starting point is a passage from classical probability theory to quantum probability theory. The quantum version of a probability distribution is a density operator, the quantum version of marginalizing is an operation called the partial trace, and the quantum version of a marginal probability distribution is a reduced density operator. Every joint probability distribution on a finite set can be modeled as a rank one density operator. By applying the partial trace, we obtain reduced density operators whose diagonals recover classical marginal probabilities. In general, these reduced densities will have rank higher than one, and their eigenvalues and eigenvectors will contain extra information that encodes subsystem interactions governed by statistics. We decode this information, and show it is akin to conditional probability, and then investigate the extent to which the eigenvectors capture concepts inherent in the original joint distribution. The theory is then illustrated with an experiment that exploits these ideas. Turning to a more theoretical application, we also discuss a preliminary framework for modeling entailment and concept hierarchy in natural language, namely, by representing expressions in the language as densities. Finally, initial inspiration for this thesis comes from formal concept analysis, which finds many striking parallels with the linear algebra. The parallels are not coincidental, and a common blueprint is found in category theory. We close with an exposition on free (co)completions and how the free-forgetful adjunctions in which they arise strongly suggest that in certain categorical contexts, the fixed points of a morphism with its adjoint encode interesting information.},

Superposition of de Broglie matter waves has been observed for massive particles such as electrons, atoms and dimers, small van der Waals clusters, and neutrons. But matter wave interferometry with larger objects has remained experimentally challenging, despite the development of powerful atom interferometric techniques for experiments in fundamental quantum mechanics, metrology and lithography. Here we report the observation of de Broglie wave interference of C60 molecules by diffraction at a material absorption grating. This molecule is the most massive and complex object in which wave behaviour has been observed. Of particular interest is the fact that C60 is almost a classical body, because of its many excited internal degrees of freedom and their possible couplings to the environment. Such couplings are essential for the appearance of decoherence, suggesting that interference experiments with large molecules should facilitate detailed studies of this process.},

Here we present three challenges to their arguments, taken from works and remarks by Kauffman, Markopoulou and Newman. These can be seen to be based on two principles: that every observable in a theory of cosmology should be measurable by some observer inside the universe, and all mathematical constructions necessary to the formulation of the theory should be realizable in a finite time by a computer that fits inside the universe. We also briefly discuss how a cosmological theory could be formulated so it is in agreement with these principles.},

@book{Barbour2001,
	abstract = {Richard Feynman once quipped that Time is what happens when nothing else does. But Julian Barbour disagrees: if nothing happened, if nothing changed, then time would stop. For time is nothing but change. It is change that we perceive occurring all around us, not time. Put simply, time does not exist. In this highly provocative volume, Barbour presents the basic evidence for a timeless universe, and shows why we still experience the world as intensely temporal. It is a book that strikes at the heart of modern physics. It casts doubt on Einstein's greatest contribution, the spacetime continuum, but also points to the solution of one of the great paradoxes of modern science, the chasm between classical and quantum physics. Indeed, Barbour argues that the holy grail of physicists--the unification of Einstein's general relativity with quantum mechanics--may well spell the end of time. Barbour writes with remarkable clarity as he ranges from the ancient philosophers Heraclitus and Parmenides, through the giants of science Galileo, Newton, and Einstein, to the work of the contemporary physicists John Wheeler, Roger Penrose, and Steven Hawking. Along the way he treats us to enticing glimpses of some of the mysteries of the universe, and presents intriguing ideas about multiple worlds, time travel, immortality, and, above all, the illusion of motion. The End of Time is a vibrantly written and revolutionary book. It turns our understanding of reality inside-out.},

@article{Loll2008,
	abstract = {Is there an approach to quantum gravity which is conceptually simple, relies on very few fundamental physical principles and ingredients, emphasizes geometric (as opposed to algebraic) properties, comes with a definite numerical approximation scheme, and produces robust results, which go beyond showing mere internal consistency of the formalism? The answer is a resounding yes: it is the attempt to construct a nonperturbative theory of quantum gravity, valid on all scales, with the technique of so-called Causal Dynamical Triangulations. Despite its conceptual simplicity, the results obtained up to now are far from trivial. Most remarkable at this stage is perhaps the fully dynamical emergence of a classical background (and solution to the Einstein equations) from a nonperturbative sum over geometries, without putting in any preferred geometric background at the outset. In addition, there is concrete evidence for the presence of a fractal spacetime foam on Planckian distance scales. The availability of a computational framework provides built-in reality checks of the approach, whose importance can hardly be overestimated.},

@article{Smolin2006,
	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to explain carefully the arguments behind the assertion that the correct quantum theory of gravity must be background independent. We begin by recounting how the debate overwhetherquantum gravity must be background independent is a continuation of a long-standing argument in the history of physics and philosophy over whether space and time are relational or absolute. This leads to a careful statement of what physicists mean when we speak of background independence. Given this we can characterize the precise sense in which general relativity is a background independent theory. The leading background independent approaches to quantum gravity are then discussed, including causal set models, loop quantum gravity and dynamical triangulations and their main achievements are summarized along with the problems that remain open. Some first attempts to cast string/M theory into a background independent formulation are also mentioned. The relational/absolute debate has implications also for other issues such as unification and how the parameters of the standard models of physics and cosmology are to be explained. The recent issues concerning the string theory landscape are reviewed and it is argued that they can only be resolved within the context of a background independent formulation. Finally, we review some recent proposals to make quantum theory more relational.},

	abstract = {We provide a mechanism by which, from a background independent model with no quantum mechanics, quantum theory arises in the same limit in which spatial properties appear. Starting with an arbitrary abstract graph as the microscopic model of spacetime, our ansatz is that the microscopic dynamics can be chosen so that 1) the model has a low low energy limit which reproduces the non-relativistic classical dynamics of a system of N particles in flat spacetime, 2) there is a minimum length, and 3) some of the particles are in a thermal bath or otherwise evolve stochastically. We then construct simple functions of the degrees of freedom of the theory and show that their probability distributions evolve according to the Schroedinger equation. The non-local hidden variables required to satisfy the conditions of Bell's theorem are the links in the fundamental graph that connect nodes adjacent in the graph but distant in the approximate metric of the low energy limit. In the presence of these links, distant stochastic fluctuations are transferred into universal quantum fluctuations.},

	abstract = {Quantum mechanics, information theory, and relativity theory are the basic foundations of theoretical physics. The acquisition of information from a quantum system is the interface of classical and quantum physics. Essential tools for its description are Kraus matrices and positive operator valued measures (POVMs). Special relativity imposes severe restrictions on the transfer of information between distant systems. Quantum entropy is not a Lorentz covariant concept. Lorentz transformations of reduced density matrices for entangled systems may not be completely positive maps. Quantum field theory, which is necessary for a consistent description of interactions, implies a fundamental trade-off between detector reliability and localizability. General relativity produces new, counterintuitive effects, in particular when black holes (or more generally, event horizons) are involved. Most of the current concepts in quantum information theory may then require a reassessment.},

Here, we analyse entanglement in multichromophoric light-harvesting complexes, and establish methods for quantification of entanglement by describing necessary and sufficient conditions for entanglement and by deriving a measure of global entanglement. These methods are then applied to the Fenna--Matthews--Olson protein to extract the initial state and temperature dependencies of entanglement. We show that, although the Fenna--Matthews--Olson protein in natural conditions largely contains bipartite entanglement between dimerized chromophores, a small amount of long-range and multipartite entanglement should exist even at physiological temperatures. This constitutes the first rigorous quantification of entanglement in a biological system. Finally, we discuss the practical use of entanglement in densely packed molecular aggregates such as light-harvesting complexes.},

@misc{Bennett2003,
	abstract = {Landauer's principle, often regarded as the foundation of the thermodynamics of information processing, holds that any logically irreversible manipulation of information, such as the erasure of a bit or the merging of two computation paths, must be accompanied by a corresponding entropy increase in non-information bearing degrees of freedom of the information processing apparatus or its environment. Conversely, it is generally accepted that any logically reversible transformation of information can in principle be accomplished by an appropriate physical mechanism operating in a thermodynamically reversible fashion. These notions have sometimes been criticized either as being false, or as being trivial and obvious, and therefore unhelpful for purposes such as explaining why Maxwell's Demon cannot violate the Second Law of thermodynamics. Here I attempt to refute some of the arguments against Landauer's principle, while arguing that although in a sense it is indeed a trivial and obvious restatement of the Second Law, it still has considerable pedagogic and explanatory power, especially in the context of other influential ideas in 19'th and 20'th century physics. Similar arguments have been given by Jeffrey Bub [arXiv:quant-ph/0203017].},

@article{Lobo2007,
	abstract = {The conceptual definition and understanding of the nature of time, both qualitatively and quantitatively is of the utmost difficulty and importance, and plays a fundamental role in physics. Physical systems seem to evolve in paths of increasing entropy and of complexity, and thus, the arrow of time shall be explored in the context of thermodynamic irreversibility and quantum physics. In Newtonian physics, time flows at a constant rate, the same for all observers; however, it necessarily flows at different rates for different observers in special and general relativity. Special relativity provides important quantitative elucidations of the fundamental processes related to time dilation effects, and general relativity provides a deep analysis to effects of time flow, such as in the presence of gravitational fields. Through the special theory of relativity, time became intimately related with space, giving rise to the notion of spacetime, in which both parameters cannot be considered as separate entities. As time is incorporated into the proper structure of the fabric of spacetime, it is interesting to note that general relativity is contaminated with non-trivial geometries that generate closed timelike curves, and thus apparently violates causality. The notion of causality is fundamental in the construction of physical theories; therefore time travel and its associated paradoxes have to be treated with great caution. These issues are briefly analyzed in this review paper.},

	abstract = {We describe applications of a virtually synchronous environment for distributed programming, which underlies a collection of distributed programming tools in the ISIS2 system. A virtually synchronous environment allows processes to be structured into process groups, and makes events like broadcasts to the group as an entity, group membership changes, and even migration of an activity from one place to another appear to occur instantaneously - in other words, synchronously. A major advantage to this approach is that many aspects of a distributed application can be treated independently without compromising correctness. Moreover, user code that is designed as if the system were synchronous can often be executed concurrently. We argue that this approach to building distributed and fault-tolerant software is more straightforward, more flexible, and more likely to yield correct solutions than alternative approaches.},

	abstract = {Entanglement is at the heart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for applications in quantum communication. Remarkably, entanglement can be `swapped': if we prepare two independent entangled pairs A1--A2 and B1--B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a `Bell-state measurement', BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled state, although these two particles have never interacted nor share any common past1,2. Entanglement swapping with photon pairs has already been experimentally demonstrated3,4,5,6 using pulsed sources---where the challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp synchronization of the photons in the BSM---but never with continuous-wave sources, as originally proposed2. Here, we present an experiment where the coherence time of the photons exceeds the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence, photon timing can be obtained by the detection times, and pulsed sources can be replaced by continuous-wave sources, which do not require any synchronization6,7. This allows for the first time the use of completely autonomous sources, an important step towards real-world quantum networks with truly independent and distant nodes.},

For this purpose a general and analytically solvable decoherence model is presented which does not involve any weak-coupling or Markovian assumption. It is shown that two fundamentally different classes of entangled states can be distinguished and that they can be influenced significantly by two important environmental properties, namely, its initially prepared state and its size. Quantum states of the first class are fragile against decoherence so that they can be disentangled asymptotically even if coherences between pointer states are still present. Quantum states of the second type are robust against decoherence. Asymptotically they can be disentangled only if also decoherence is perfect. A simple criterion for identifying these two classes on the basis of two-qubit entanglement is presented.},

	abstract = {The effects of distinct agent interaction and activation structures are compared and contrasted in several multi-agent models of social phenomena. Random graphs and lattices represent two limiting kinds of agent interaction networks studied, with so-called 'small-world' networks being an intermediate form between these two extremes. A model of retirement behavior is studied with each network type, resulting in important differences in key model outputs. Then, in the context of a model of firm formation, in which multi-agent structures (firms) are emergent, it is demonstrated that the medium of interaction -- whether through individual agents or through firms -- affects the qualitative character of the results. Finally, alternative agent activation 'schedules' are studied. In particular, two activation modes are compared: (1) all agents being active exactly once each period, and (2) each agent having a random number of activations in every period with mean 1. In many circumstances these two regimes produce indistinguishable results at the aggregate level, but in certain cases the differences between them are significant.},

Yet that is just supposition. We have no real evidence that it actually happened this way. In later recollections, Einstein stressed the importance of several thought experiments in the thinking that led up to the final theory. They include his chasing a light beam thought experiment and his magnet and conductor thought experiment. They do not include thought experiments on clocks and their synchronization. My goal here is to show that other pathways to the relativity of simultaneity are quite plausible. In several places Einstein stressed the importance in his discovery of special relativity of stellar aberration and Fizeau's measurement of the speed of light in moving water. The results can be seen as direct observational expressions of the relativity of simultaneity, if one knows how to read them. I will suggest that, thanks to his knowledge of Lorentz's 1895 Versuch, Einstein did know how to read them, and that it is quite possible that these observations first led Einstein to the relativity of simultaneity.},

A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

I show that, within a quantum mechanical framework, all phenomena which leave a trail of information behind (and hence can be studied by physics) are those where entropy necessarily increases or remains constant. All phenomena where the entropy decreases must not leave any information of their having happened. This situation is completely indistinguishable from their not having happened at all. In the light of this observation, the second law of thermodynamics is reduced to a mere tautology: physics cannot study those processes where entropy has decreased, even if they were commonplace.},

	abstract = {Agent-based modeling is a technique for modeling dynamic systems from the bottom up. Individual elements of the system are represented computationally as agents. The system-level behaviors emerge from the micro-level interactions of the agents. Contemporary state-of-the-art agent-based modeling toolkits are essentially discrete-event simulators designed to execute serially on the Central Processing Unit (CPU). They simulate Agent-Based Models (ABMs) by executing agent actions one at a time. In addition to imposing an un-natural execution order, these toolkits have limited scalability. In this article, we investigate data-parallel computer architectures such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to simulate large scale ABMs. We have developed a series of efficient, data parallel algorithms for handling environment updates, various agent interactions, agent death and replication, and gathering statistics.  We present three fundamental innovations that provide unprecedented scalability. The first is a novel stochastic memory allocator which enables parallel agent replication in O(1) average time. The second is a technique for resolving precedence constraints for agent actions in parallel. The third is a method that uses specialized graphics hardware, to gather and process statistical measures. These techniques have been implemented on a modern day GPU resulting in a substantial performance increase.  We believe that our system is the first ever completely GPU based agent simulation framework. Although GPUs are the focus of our current implementations, our techniques can easily be adapted to other data-parallel architectures. We have benchmarked our framework against contemporary toolkits using two popular ABMs, namely, SugarScape and StupidModel.},

The two sources and the relay use the same channel resources (i.e. co-channel transmission). We assume Gaussian channels with time-invariant channel gains which are known by all nodes. The two source nodes are connected by orthogonal limited-rate error-free conferencing links. By extending the proof of the converse for the Gaussian relay channel and introducing two lemmas on conditional (co-)variance, we present two genie-aided outer bounds of the capacity region for this multicast relay network. We extend noisy network coding to use source cooperation with the help of the theory of network equivalence. We also propose a new coding scheme, partial-decode-and-forward based linear network coding, which is essentially a hybrid scheme utilizing rate-splitting and messages conferencing at the source nodes, partial decoding and linear network coding at the relay, and joint decoding at each destination. A low-complexity alternative scheme, analog network coding based on amplify-and-forward relaying, is also investigated and shown to benefit greatly from the help of the conferencing links and can even outperform noisy network coding when the coherent combining gain is dominant.},

A cluster is a collection of m nodes, and there are n clusters. For data collection, we download the entire content from any k clusters. For repair of t ≥ 2 nodes within a cluster, we take help from ℓ local nodes, as well as d helper clusters. We characterize the optimal trade-off under functional repair, and also under exact repair for the minimum storage and minimum inter-cluster bandwidth (MBR) operating points. Our bounds show the following interesting facts: 1) When t{\textbar}(m - ℓ) the tradeoff is the same as that under t = 1, and thus there is no advantage in jointly repairing multiple nodes, 2) When t{\l}(m - ℓ), the optimal file-size at the MBR point under exact repair can be strictly less than that under functional repair. 3) Unlike the case of t = 1, increasing the number of local helper nodes does not necessarily increase the system capacity under functional repair.},

We show that, as the bandwidth increases to infinity, the capacity goes to zero when signaling is constrained in its second moment and peak signal amplitude. This result is consistent with similar results which do not consider doubly block-fading channels. None of these results, however, offer a range for the optimal spreading bandwidth, because they consider only upper bounds to capacity. While we know that spreading over very large bandwidths is detrimental in terms of capacity, we wish to determine over what range of bandwidths spreading is beneficial. We are able to give a range for the optimal spreading bandwidth by combining our upper bound with a suitable lower bound.},

	abstract = {We consider the issue of protection in very large networks displaying randomness in topology. We employ random graph models to describe such networks, and obtain probabilistic bounds on several parameters related to reliability. In particular, we take the case of random regular networks for simplicity and consider the length of primary and backup paths in terms of the number of hops. First, for a randomly picked pair of nodes, we derive a lower bound on the average distance between the pair and discuss the tightness of the bound. In addition, noting that primary and protection paths form cycles, we obtain a lower bound on the average length of the shortest cycle around the pair. Finally, we show that the protected connections of a given maximum finite length are rare. We then generalize our network model so that different degrees are allowed according to some arbitrary distribution, and show that the second moment of degree over the first moment is an important shorthand for behavior of a network. Notably, we show that most of the results in regular networks carry over with minor modifications, which significantly broadens the scope of networks to which our approach applies. We present as an example the case of networks with a power-law degree distribution.},

	abstract = {Erasure codes offer an efficient way to decrease storage and communication costs while implementing atomic memory service in asynchronous distributed storage systems. In this paper, we provide erasure-code-based algorithms having the additional ability to perform background repair of crashed nodes. A repair operation of a node in the crashed state is triggered externally, and is carried out by the concerned node via message exchanges with other active nodes in the system. Upon completion of repair, the node re-enters active state, and resumes participation in ongoing and future read, write, and repair operations. To guarantee liveness and atomicity simultaneously, existing works assume either the presence of nodes with stable storage, or presence of nodes that never crash during the execution. We demand neither of these; instead we consider a natural, yet practical network stability condition \$N1\$ that only restricts the number of nodes in the crashed/repair state during broadcast of any message. We present an erasure-code based algorithm \$RADON\_C\$ that is always live, and guarantees atomicity as long as condition \$N1\$ holds. In situations when the number of concurrent writes is limited, \$RADON\_C\$ has significantly improved storage and communication cost over a replication-based algorithm \$RADON\_R\$, which also works under \$N1\$. We further show how a slightly stronger network stability condition \$N2\$ can be used to construct algorithms that never violate atomicity. The guarantee of atomicity comes at the expense of having an additional phase during the read and write operations.},

	abstract = {We study an online random linear network coding approach for time division duplexing (TDD) channels under Poisson arrivals. We model the system as a bulk-service queue with variable bulk size and with feedback, i.e., when a set of packets are serviced at a given time, they might be reintroduced to the queue to form part of the next service batch. We show that there is an optimal number of coded data packets that the sender should transmit back-to-back before stopping to wait for an acknowledgement from the receiver. This number depends on the latency, probability of packet erasure, degrees of freedom at the receiver, the size of the coding window, and the arrival rate of the Poisson process. Random network coding is performed across a moving window of packets that depends on the packets in the queue, design constraints on the window size, and the feedback sent from the receiver. We study the mean time between generating a packet at the source and it being  seen , but not necessarily decoded, at the receiver. We also analyze the mean time between a decoding event and the next, defined as the decoding of all the packets that have been previously  seen  and those packets involved in the current window of packets. Inherently, a decoding event implies an in-order decoding of a batch of data packets. We present numerical results illustrating the trade-off between mean delay and mean time between decoding events.},

However, the performance of such schemes can be highly affected by scheduling constraints and unreliable feedback. Network coding, on the other hand, has been shown to reduce scheduling and prioritization problems and to perform well in wireless scenarios with perfect feedback. Motivated by this observation, we implement and analyze a system architecture for network coding-based multiresolution video streaming in a wireless environment. In contrast to existing work, we take into account realistic feedback, where the control packets are sent over the same unreliable channel as data packets, and compare it to the case of perfect feedback, where the server has perfect knowledge of the state of the buffer at every receiver. We provide an evaluation of the system via simulation and show that even in highly volatile environments, a network coding-based scheme with limited and unreliable feedback can achieve a good performance.},

Network coding makes minimum-cost multicast, an NP-complete problem with traditional routing alone, polynomially solvable, but if we consider the network coding capability as a resource, the link cost is actually minimized at the expense of the coding cost. We show that identifying such a tradeoff is NP-hard. For this problem, we propose an evolutionary approach that generalizes our previously proposed algorithms for coding resource optimization. Based on an existing multi-objective genetic algorithm, we develop a novel selection mechanism that utilizes some specific characteristics of the problem. We then show that the algorithm can be implemented in a distributed manner and evaluate the algorithm's performance by performing experiments on several topologies.},

	abstract = {We study the gains to be had by using random linear coding (RLC) for simultaneously disseminating k distinct messages in a network of n nodes in a decentralized and distributed manner for arbitrary k and n. The goal is to rapidly disseminate all the messages among all the nodes. Any node can communicate with any of the other nodes but only one at a time, nodes only have knowledge about their own contents, and the bandwidth for every transmission between two nodes is limited (does not scale with k or n). An efficient and well-studied protocol for message dissemination in such a framework is randomized gossip based message dissemination. The problem has been studied extensively without using any coding for message dissemination. We show using analysis and simulation that, in the regime k ges (ln(n))3, RLC based dissemination reduces the dissemination time (the time-steps to disseminate all the messages among all the nodes) by a factor of otimes(ln(n)) as compared to disseminating the messages sequentially (i.e., one after the other) as implicit in most non-coding based technique. In the regime k les (ln(n))2, the dissemination time with RLC goes down by a factor of Omega(radick / ln k). More precisely, our results indicate that a RLC based protocol disseminates all the messages among all the nodes in time ck + O(radick ln(k)(ln(n)) for a suitable constant c {\textgreater} 0. Analytical results show that, c {\textless} 3.46 using pull based dissemination, and c {\textless} 5.96 using push based dissemination, but reported simulations suggest c {\textless} 2 might be a tighter bound},

	abstract = {We propose a new queueing mechanism for coded networks with stochastic arrivals and/or lossy links. In this context, earlier work introduced the notion of  virtual queues  which represent the backlog in degrees of freedom. For instance, the work by Ho and Viswanathan defined the achievable rate region for which the virtual queue size is stabilized, using intra-session coding. The queueing scheme that we propose here forms a natural bridge between the virtual queue size and the physical queue size, and thus extends their result to the stability of the physical queues as well. Specifically, we show that the amount of memory used at the transmit buffer in our scheme is upper bounded by the total backlog in the number of linearly independent degrees of freedom. Moreover, our scheme gives an online algorithm for queue update and coding, in the sense that the coding does not happen block by block, but in a streaming manner. The main idea in our scheme is to ensure that the information stored at the sender excludes any knowledge that is common to all receivers. This requires the transmitting node to track the states of knowledge of its receivers. Therefore, if the links are lossy, some form of feedback may be necessary.},

The setup assumes a packet erasure channel, slotted time, and that nodes cannot transmit and receive information simultaneously. The dissemination process is completed when all terminals can decode the original data packets. We also assume a perfect knowledge of the information at each of the nodes, but not necessarily a perfect knowledge of the channel. A centralized controller decides which nodes should transmit, to what set of receiver nodes, and what information should be broadcasted. We show that the problem can be thought of as a scheduling problem, which is hard to solve. Thus, we consider the use of a greedy algorithm that only takes into account the current state of the system to make a decision. The proposed algorithm tries to maximize the impact on the network at each slot, i.e. maximize the number of nodes that will benefit from the coded packet sent by each active transmitter. We show that our scheme is considerably better, in terms of the number of slots to complete transmission, than schemes that choose the node with more information as the transmitter at every time slot.},

We construct a model for the behavior of the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol and apply it to key small canonical topology components and their larger counterparts. The results obtained from this model match the available experimental results with fidelity. Using this model, we show that fairness allocation by the 802.11 MAC can significantly impede performance; hence, we devise a new MAC that not only substantially improves throughput, but provides fairness to flows of information rather than to nodes. We show that cooperation between NC, MPR, and our new MAC achieves super-additive gains of up to 6.3 times that of routing with the standard 802.11 MAC. Furthermore, we extend the model to analyze our MAC's asymptotic and throughput behaviors as the number of nodes increases or the MPR capability is limited to only a single node. Finally, we show that although network performance is reduced under substantial asymmetry or limited implementation of MPR to a central node, there are some important practical cases, even under these conditions, where MPR, NC, and their combination provide significant gains.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a class of Locally Adaptive Sampling schemes. In this sampling family, time intervals between samples can be computed by using a function of previously taken samples, called a sampling function. Hence, though it is a non-uniform sampling scheme, we do not need to keep sampling times. The aim of LAS is to have the average sampling rate and the reconstruction error satisfy some requirements. We propose four different schemes of LAS. The first two are designed for deterministic signals. First, we derive a Taylor Series Expansion (TSE) sampling function, which only assumes the third derivative of the signal is bounded, but requires no other specific knowledge of the signal. Then, a Discrete Time-Valued (DTV) sampling function is proposed, where the sampling time intervals are chosen from a lattice. Next, we consider stochastic signals. We propose two sampling methods based on linear prediction filters: a Generalized Linear Prediction (GLP) sampling function, and a Linear Prediction sampling function with Side Information (LPSI). In GLP method, we only assume the signal is locally stationary. However, LPSI is specifically designed for a known signal model.},

@article{Chen2017,
	abstract = {Modern optical network systems are evolving toward more spectral flexibility and efficiency driven by the ever-increasing need for high-speed transmission. In spectrally efficient elastic optical networks, a more integrated, fault tolerant transmission system is becoming critical, due to the accompanying optical impairments and the resulting limitations in optical reach. Previous work has addressed the issue of optical reach and transmission tolerance to faults (errors) in the physical layer by deploying various forward error correction schemes. This paper proposes a different approach, complementary to the error correction mechanisms in the physical layer. In our approach, we apply randomized linear network coding (RLNC) at the source node to encode all data in the electronic layer before all-optical transmission. To achieve fault tolerance, a coded auxiliary optical channel is used in parallel with the main path. With the auxiliary path and RLNC, as shown analytically, the system is able to use more advanced modulation formats in the main path, while being highly tolerant to bit errors and packet loss caused by optical impairments. The results show that the system can alleviate the constraints on optical transmission quality and achieve better optical reach and spectral efficiency.},

	abstract = {In network function computation is as a means to reduce the required communication flow in terms of number of bits transmitted per source symbol. However, the rate region for the function computation problem in general topologies is an open problem, and has only been considered under certain restrictive assumptions (e.g. tree networks, linear functions, etc.). In this paper, we propose a new perspective for distributing computation, and formulate a flow-based delay cost minimization problem that jointly captures the costs of communications and computation. We introduce the notion of entropic surjectivity as a measure to determine how sparse the function is and to understand the limits of computation. Exploiting Little's law for stationary systems, we provide a connection between this new notion and the computation processing factor that reflects the proportion of flow that requires communications. This connection gives us an understanding of how much a node (in isolation) should compute to communicate the desired function within the network without putting any assumptions on the topology. Our analysis characterizes the functions only via their entropic surjectivity, and provides insight into how to distribute computation. We numerically test our technique for search, MapReduce, and classification tasks, and infer for each task how sensitive the processing factor to the entropic surjectivity is.},

We generalize a previous framework for designing utility-optimal differentially private (DP) mechanisms via graphs, where datasets are vertices in the graph and edges represent dataset neighborhood. The boundary set contains datasets where an individual's response changes the binary-valued query compared to its neighbors. Previous work was limited to the homogeneous case where the privacy parameter ε across all datasets was the same and the mechanism at boundary datasets was identical. In our work, the mechanism can take different distributions at the boundary and the privacy parameter ε is a function of neighboring datasets, which recovers an earlier definition of personalized DP as special case. The problem is how to extend the mechanism, which is only defined at the boundary set, to other datasets in the graph in a computationally efficient and utility optimal manner. Using the concept of strongest induced DP condition we solve this problem efficiently in polynomial time (in the size of the graph).},

	abstract = {We consider the remote computation of a function of two sources where one is receiver side information. Specifically, given side information Y, we wish to compute f(X, Y) based on information transmitted by X over a noise-less channel. The goal is to characterize the minimal rate at which X must transmit information to enable the computation of the function f. Recently, Orlitsky and Roche (2001) established that the conditional graph entropy of the characteristic graph of the function is a solution to this problem. Their achievability scheme does not separate  functional coding  from the well understood distributed source coding problem. In this paper, we seek a separation between the functional coding and the coding for correlation. In other words, we want to preprocess X (with respect to f), and then transmit the preprocessed data using a standard Slepian-Wolf coding scheme at the Orlitsky-Roche rate. We establish that a minimum (conditional) entropy coloring of the product of characteristic graphs is asymptotically equal to the conditional graph entropy. This can be seen as a generalization of a result of Korner (1973) which shows that the minimum entropy coloring of product graphs is asymptotically equal to the graph entropy. Thus, graph coloring provides a modular technique to achieve coding gains when the receiver is interested in decoding some function of the source.},

@article{Babarczi2017,
	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new proactive recovery scheme against single edge failures for unicast connections in transport networks. The new scheme is a generalization of diversity coding where the source data AB are split into two parts A and B and three data flows A, B, and their exclusive OR (XOR) A⊕B are sent along the network between the source and the destination node of the connection. By ensuring that two data flows out of the three always operate even if a single edge fails, the source data can be instantaneously recovered at the destination node. In contrast with diversity coding, we do not require the three data flows to be routed along three disjoint paths; however, in our scheme, a data flow is allowed to split into two parallel segments and later merge back. Thus, our generalized diversity coding (GDC) scheme can be used in sparse but still two-connected network topologies. Our proof improves an earlier result of network coding, by using purely graph theoretical tool set instead of algebraic argument. In particular, we show that when the source data are divided into two parts, robust intra-session network coding against single edge failures is always possible without any in-network algebraic operation. We present linear-time robust code construction algorithms for this practical special case in minimal coding graphs. We further characterize this question, and show that by increasing the number of edge failures and source data parts, we lose these desired properties.},

The transmitted, colliding packets may themselves be a coded version of the original packets. We propose a new acknowledgment (ACK) mechanism for collisions based on the idea that if a set of packets collide, the receiver can afford to ACK exactly one of them and still decode all the packets eventually.

@article{Salamatian2020,
	abstract = {According to recent empirical studies, a majority of users have the same, or very similar, passwords across multiple password-secured online services. This practice can have disastrous consequences, as one password being compromised puts all the other accounts at much higher risk. Generally, an adversary may use any side-information he/she possesses about the user, be it demographic information, password reuse on a previously compromised account, or any other relevant information to devise a better brute-force strategy (so called targeted attack). In this work, we consider a distributed brute-force attack scenario in which m adversaries, each observing some side information, attempt breaching a password secured system. We compare two strategies: an uncoordinated attack in which the adversaries query the system based on their own side-information until they find the correct password, and a fully coordinated attack in which the adversaries pool their side-information and query the system together. For passwords X of length n, generated independently and identically from a distribution PX, we establish an asymptotic closed-form expression for the uncoordinated and coordinated strategies when the side-information Y(m) are generated independently from passing X through a memoryless channel PY{\textbar}X, as the length of the password n goes to infinity. We illustrate our results for binary symmetric channels and binary erasure channels, two families of side-information channels which model password reuse. We demonstrate that two coordinated agents perform asymptotically better than any finite number of uncoordinated agents for these channels, meaning that sharing side-information is very valuable in distributed attacks.},

The CSI need not be perfect, and we consider the case where the transmitter and receiver have the same causal CSI as well as the case where the transmitter CSI is a deterministic function of the receiver CSI. For block-memoryless and asymptotically block-memoryless channels, our coding strategy averages mutual information density over multiple transmission blocks to achieve the maximum average mutual information.

In this channel, the transmitter may be unable to control precisely the number of particles released, and the receiver may not detect all the particles that arrive. We demonstrate that the optimal input distribution for this channel always has mass points at zero and the maximum number of particles that can be released.

	abstract = {Whereas the theory and application of optimal network coding are well studied for the single-session multicast scenario, there is no known optimal network coding strategy for a more general connection problem where there are more than one session and receivers may demand different sets of information. Though there have been a number of recent studies that demonstrate various utilities of network coding in the multi- session scenario, they rely on very restricted classes of codes in terms of the coding operations allowed and/or the location of decoding. In this paper, we propose a novel inter-session network coding strategy for a general connection problem. Our coding strategy allows fairly general random linear coding over a large finite field, in which decoding is done at receivers and the mixture of information at interior nodes is controlled by evolutionary mechanisms. We demonstrate how our coding strategy may surpass existing end-to-end pairwise XOR coding schemes in terms of effectiveness and practicality.},

Unlike traditional Byzantine detection protocols which are receiver-based, this protocol gives the senders an active role in checking the node downstream. This work is inspired by Marti et al.'s watchdog-pathrater, which attempts to detect and mitigate the effects of routing misbehavior. As the first building block of a such system, we focus on a two-hop network. We present a graphical model to understand the inference process nodes execute to police their downstream neighbors; as well as to compute, analyze, and approximate the probabilities of misdetection and false detection. In addition, we present an algebraic analysis of the performance using an hypothesis testing framework, that provides exact formulae for probabilities of false detection and misdetection.},

We empirically contrast the performance of the proposed approach using AES as error correction with that of Random Linear Codes and CA-Polar codes and show that in practical scenarios, they achieve almost the same performance.

	abstract = {Security against eavesdropping is one of the key concerns in the design of any communication system. Many common considerations of the security of a wireless communication channel rely on comparing the signal level measured by Bob (the intended receiver) to that accessible to Eve (an eavesdropper). Frameworks such as Wyner's wiretap model ensure the security of a link, in an average sense, when Bob's signal-to-noise ratio exceeds Eve's. Unfortunately, because these guarantees rely on statistical assumptions about noise, Eve can still occasionally succeed in decoding information. The goal of achieving exactly zero probability of intercept over an engineered region of the broadcast sector, which we term absolute security, remains elusive. Here, we describe the first architecture for a wireless link which provides absolute security. Our approach relies on the inherent properties of broadband and high-gain antennas, and is therefore ideally suited for implementation in millimeter-wave and terahertz wireless systems, where such antennas will generally be employed. We exploit spatial minima of the antenna pattern at different frequencies, the union of which defines a wide region where Eve is guaranteed to fail regardless of her computational capabilities, and regardless of the noise in the channels. Unlike conventional zero-forcing beam forming methods, we show that, for realistic assumptions about the antenna configuration and power budget, this absolute security guarantee can be achieved over most possible eavesdropper locations. Since we use relatively simple frequency-multiplexed coding, together with the underlying physics of a diffracting aperture, this idea is broadly applicable in many contexts.},

@inproceedings{Konwar2017,
	abstract = {Motivated by emerging applications to the edge computing paradigm, we introduce a two-layer erasure-coded fault-tolerant distributed storage system offering atomic access for read and write operations. In edge computing, clients interact with an edge-layer of servers that is geographically near; the edge-layer in turn interacts with a back-end layer of servers. The edge-layer provides low latency access and temporary storage for client operations, and uses the back-end layer for persistent storage. Our algorithm, termed Layered Data Storage (LDS) algorithm, offers several features suitable for edge-computing systems, works under asynchronous message-passing environments, supports multiple readers and writers, and can tolerate f1 {\textless} n1/2 and f2 {\textless} n2/3 crash failures in the two layers having n1 and n2 servers, respectively. We use a class of erasure codes known as regenerating codes for storage of data in the back-end layer. The choice of regenerating codes, instead of popular choices like Reed-Solomon codes, not only optimizes the cost of back-end storage, but also helps in optimizing communication cost of read operations, when the value needs to be recreated all the way from the back-end. The two-layer architecture permits a modular implementation of atomicity and erasure-code protocols; the implementation of erasure-codes is mostly limited to interaction between the two layers. We prove liveness and atomicity of LDS, and also compute performance costs associated with read and write operations. In a system with n1 = Θ(n2), f1 = Θ(n1), f2 = Θ(n2), the write and read costs are respectively given by Θ(n1) and Θ(1) + n1 I(δ {\textgreater} 0). Here δ is a parameter closely related to the number of write operations that are concurrent with the read operation, and I(δ {\textgreater} 0) is 1 if δ {\textgreater} 0, and 0 if δ = 0. The cost of persistent storage in the back-end layer is Θ(1). The impact of temporary storage is minimally felt in a multi-object system running N independent instances of LDS, where only a small fraction of the objects undergo concurrent accesses at any point during the execution. For the multi-object system, we identify a condition on the rate of concurrent writes in the system such that the overall storage cost is dominated by that of persistent storage in the back-end layer, and is given by Θ(N).},

We also prove that the strings whose guesswork is smaller than a given string are concentrated on the tilted family.

	abstract = {In September 2017, the McAfee Labs quarterly report estimated that brute-force attacks represent 20\% of total network attacks, making them the most prevalent type of attack ex-aequo with browser-based vulnerabilities. These attacks have sometimes catastrophic consequences, and understanding their fundamental limits may play an important role in the risk assessment of password-secured systems and in the design of better security protocols. While some solutions exist to prevent online brute-force attacks that arise from one single IP address, attacks performed by botnets are more challenging. In this paper, we analyze these distributed attacks by using a simplified model. Our aim is to understand the impact of distribution and asynchronization on the overall computational effort necessary to breach a system. Our result is based on guesswork, a measure of the number of queries (guesses) before a correct sequence, such as a password, is found in an optimal attack. Guesswork is a direct surrogate for time and computational effort of guessing a sequence from a set of sequences with the associated likelihoods. We model the lack of synchronization by a worst-case optimization in which the queries made by multiple adversarial agents are received in the worst possible order for the adversary, resulting in a min-max formulation. We show that, even without synchronization, and for sequences of growing length, the asymptotic optimal performance is achievable by using randomized guesses drawn from an appropriate distribution. Therefore, randomization is key for the distributed asynchronous attacks. In other words, asynchronous guessers can asymptotically perform brute-force attacks as efficiently as synchronized guessers.},

	abstract = {The throughput benefits of random linear network codes have been studied extensively for wirelined and wireless erasure networks. It is often assumed that all nodes within a network perform coding operations. In energy-constrained systems, however, coding subgraphs should be chosen to control the number of coding nodes while maintaining throughput. In this paper, we explore the strategic use of network coding in the wireless packet erasure relay channel according to both throughput and energy metrics. In the relay channel, a single source communicates to a single sink through the aid of a halfduplex relay. The fluid flow model is used to describe the case where both the source and the relay are coding, and Markov chain models are proposed to describe packet evolution if only the source or only the relay is coding. In addition to transmission energy, we take into account coding and reception energies. We show that coding at the relay alone while operating in a rateless fashion is neither throughput nor energy efficient. Given a set of system parameters, our analysis determines the optimal amount of time the relay should participate in the transmission, and where coding should be performed.},

	abstract = {The goal of this paper is two-fold. First, to establish a tractable model for the underwater acoustic channel useful for network optimization in terms of convexity. Second, to propose a network coding based lower bound for transmission power in underwater acoustic networks, and compare this bound to the performance of several network layer schemes. The underwater acoustic channel is characterized by a path loss that depends strongly on transmission distance and signal frequency. The exact relationship among power, transmission band, distance and capacity for the Gaussian noise scenario is a complicated one. We provide a closed-form approximate model for 1) transmission power and 2) optimal frequency band to use, as functions of distance and capacity. The model is obtained through numerical evaluation of analytical results that take into account physical models of acoustic propagation loss and ambient noise. Network coding is applied to determine a lower bound to transmission power for a multicast scenario, for a variety of multicast data rates and transmission distances of interest for practical systems, exploiting physical properties of the underwater acoustic channel. The results quantify the performance gap in transmission power between a variety of routing and network coding schemes and the network coding based lower bound. We illustrate results numerically for different network scenarios.},

	abstract = {This paper shows the potential and key enabling mechanisms for tunable sparse network coding, a scheme in which the density of network coded packets varies during a transmission session. At the beginning of a transmission session, sparsely coded packets are transmitted, which benefits decoding complexity. As the transmission continues and the receivers have accumulated coded packets, the coding density is increased. We propose a family of tunable sparse network codes (TSNCs) for multicast erasure networks with a controllable trade-off between completion time performance to decoding complexity. Coding density tuning can be performed by designing time-dependent coding matrices. In multicast networks, this tuning can be performed within the network by designing time-dependent pre-coding and network coding matrices with mild conditions on the network structure for specific densities. We present a mechanism to perform efficient Gaussian elimination over sparse matrices going beyond belief propagation but maintaining low decoding complexity. Supporting implementation results are provided showing the trade-off between decoding complexity and completion time.},

@article{Feizi2012,
	abstract = {A fundamental understanding of the relationship between delay performance and complexity in network coding is instrumental towards its application in practical systems. The main argument against delay-optimal random linear network coding (RLNC) is its decoding complexity, which is O(n3) for n original packets. Fountain codes, such as LT and Raptor codes, reduce the decoding load on the receiver but at the cost of introducing additional, non-negligible delay. The source of this increased delay is the inherent sparsity of the code, which significantly reduces the impact of a new coded packet, i.e., the probability of a packet to be linearly independent from the knowledge at the receiver, as we approach the end of the transmission (when few degrees of freedom are missing). Thus, the additional overhead is mainly due to the transmission of the last data packets. Our key observation is that switching gears to denser codes as the transmission process progresses could considerably reduce the delay overhead while maintaining the complexity advantages of a sparse code. We propose tunable sparse network coding as a dynamic coding mechanism with a code structure with two regions: a sparse region, with various levels of sparsity, and a dense region, where packets are generated as per RLNC. We characterize the problem in multicast sessions on general networks and illustrate trade-offs in especial cases of interest. We also present a novel mechanism to perform efficient Gaussian elimination for sparse matrices that guarantees linear decoding complexity with high probability.},

This model allows us to consider issues of failure localization that cannot be addressed through models that assume only single failures. Based on the relationship between algorithmic properties and restoration failures, we construct a failure classification hierarchy that provides insight as to the relative value of advances in algorithm design. Finally, we apply this classification scheme to three networks from the literature and discuss the results in terms of their importance for link restoration algorithms. We find that the topological constraints on restoration paths required by algorithms that embed rings within mesh networks result in significant degradation of failure localization. The preselection of restoration paths (as opposed to selection at the time of failure) also has a negative impact, although it is not as significant as the topological effect. Algorithms that make use of the mesh topology and dynamically route around existing failures come close to an inherent limit imposed by the complexity of additional algorithmic advances.},

Network nodes independently and randomly select linear mappings from inputs onto output links over some field. We show that this achieves optimal capacity with probability rapidly approaching 1 with the code length. We also demonstrate that randomized coding performs compression when necessary in a network, generalizing error exponents for linear Slepian-Wolf coding in a natural way. Benefits of this approach are decentralized operation and robustness to network changes or link failures. We show that this approach can take advantage of redundant network capacity for improved performance and robustness. We illustrate some potential advantages of randomized network coding over routing in two examples of practical scenarios: distributed network operation and online algorithms for networks with dynamically varying connections. Our mathematical development of these results also provides a link between network coding and network flows/bipartite matching, leading to a new bound on required field size for centralized network coding on general multicast networks.},

	abstract = {Future 5G systems will need to support ultra-reliable low-latency communications scenarios. From a latency-reliability viewpoint, it is inefficient to rely on average utility-based system design. Therefore, we introduce the notion of guaranteeable delay which is the average delay plus three standard deviations of the mean. We investigate the trade-off between guaranteeable delay and throughput for the point-to-point wireless erasure links with unreliable and delayed feedback, by bringing together signal flow techniques to the area of coding. We use tiny codes, i.e., sliding window by coding with just 2 packets, and design three variations of selective-repeat ARQ protocols, by building on the baseline scheme, i.e., uncoded ARQ, developed by Ausavapattanakun and Nosratinia: (i) Hybrid ARQ with soft combining at the receiver; (ii) cumulative feedback-based ARQ without rate adaptation; and (iii) coded ARQ with rate adaptation based on the cumulative feedback. Contrasting the performance of these protocols with uncoded ARQ, we demonstrate that the HARQ performs only slightly better, the cumulative feedback-based ARQ does not provide significant throughput while it has a better average delay, and the Coded ARQ can provide gains up to about 40\% in terms of throughput. The Coded ARQ also provides delay guarantees, and is robust to various challenges such as imperfect and delayed feedback, burst erasures, and round-trip time fluctuations. This feature may be preferable for meeting the strict end-to-end latency and reliability requirements of the future use cases of ultra-reliable low-latency communications in 5G, such as mission-critical communications and industrial control for critical control messaging.},

	abstract = {We study a generalization of the setting of regenerating codes, motivated by applications to storage systems consisting of clusters of storage nodes. There are n clusters in total, with m nodes per cluster. A data file is coded and stored across the mn nodes, with each node storing α symbols. For availability of data, we require that the file be retrievable by downloading the entire content from any subset of k clusters. Nodes represent entities that can fail. We distinguish between intra-cluster and inter-cluster bandwidth (BW) costs during node repair. Node-repair in a cluster is accomplished by downloading β symbols each from any set of d other clusters, dubbed remote helper clusters, and also up to α symbols each from any set of I surviving nodes, dubbed local helper nodes, in the host cluster. We first identify the optimal trade-off between storage-overhead and inter-cluster repair-bandwidth under functional repair, and also present optimal exact-repair code constructions for a class of parameters. The new trade-off is strictly better than what is achievable via space-sharing existing coding solutions, whenever ℓ {\textgreater} 0. We then obtain sharp lower bounds on the necessary intracluster repair BW to achieve optimal trade-off. Under functional repair, random linear network codes (RLNCs) simultaneously optimize usage of both inter- and intra-cluster repair BW; simulation results based on RLNCs suggest optimality of the bounds on intra-cluster repair-bandwidth. Our bounds reveal the interesting fact that, while it is beneficial to increase the number of local helper nodes I in order to improve the storage-vs-inter-cluster-repair-BW trade-off, increasing I not only increases intracluster BW in the host-cluster, but also increases the intra-cluster BW in the remote helper clusters. We also analyze resilience of the clustered storage system against passive eavesdropping by providing file-size bounds and optimal code constructions.},

	abstract = {Quantization allows physical signals to be processed using digital devices. Quantizers are commonly implemented using analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), which operate in a serial and scalar manner and are designed to yield an accurate digital representation of the observed signal. However, in many practical scenarios quantization is part of a system whose task is not to recover the observed signal, but some function of it. Recent works have shown that properly designed task-based quantizers, which include pre-quantization analog combining as well as digital processing, can achieve notable gains in recovering linear functions of the observations. In this work we focus on quantization for the task of recovering quadratic functions. Our analysis is based on principal inertia components (PICs), which form a basis for decomposing the statistical dependence between random quantities. Using PICs, we identify a practical structure of the pre-quantization mapping for recovering quadratic functions, which allows us to design a task-based quantization system capable of accurately estimating these functions. Our numerical study demonstrates that, when using scalar ADCs, notable performance gains that can be achieved using the proposed design over intuitive approaches such as quantizing the quadratic function directly as well as task-ignorant quantization.},

	abstract = {Network alignment refers to the problem of finding a bijective mapping across vertices of two or more graphs to maximize the number of overlapping edges and/or to minimize the number of mismatched interactions across networks. This paper introduces a network alignment algorithm inspired by eigenvector analysis which creates a simple relaxation for the underlying quadratic assignment problem. Our method relaxes binary assignment constraints along the leading eigenvector of an alignment matrix which captures the structure of matched and mismatched interactions across networks. Our proposed algorithm denoted by EigeAlign has two steps. First, it computes the Perron-Frobenius eigenvector of the alignment matrix. Second, it uses this eigenvector in a linear optimization framework of maximum weight bipartite matching to infer bijective mappings across vertices of two graphs. Unlike existing network alignment methods, EigenAlign considers both matched and mismatched interactions in its optimization and therefore, it is effective in aligning networks even with low similarity. We show that, when certain technical conditions hold, the relaxation given by EigenAlign is asymptotically exact over Erdos-Renyi graphs with high probability. Moreover, for modular network structures, we show that EigenAlign can be used to split the large quadratic assignment optimization into small subproblems, enabling the use of computationally expensive, but tight semidefinite relaxations over each subproblem. Through simulations, we show the effectiveness of the EigenAlign algorithm in aligning various network structures including Erdos-Renyi, power law, and stochastic block models, under different noise models. Finally, we apply EigenAlign to compare gene regulatory networks across human, fly and worm species which we infer by integrating genome-wide functional and physical genomics datasets from ENCODE and modENCODE consortia. EigenAlign infers conserved regulatory interactions across these species despite large evolutionary distances spanned. We find strong conservation of centrally-connected genes and some biological pathways, especially for human-fly comparisons.},

	abstract = {Graph alignment refers to the problem of finding a bijective mapping across vertices of two graphs such that, if two nodes are connected in the first graph, their images are connected in the second graph. This problem arises in many fields, such as computational biology, social sciences, and computer vision and is often cast as a quadratic assignment problem (QAP). Most standard graph alignment methods consider an optimization that maximizes the number of matches between the two graphs, ignoring the effect of mismatches. We propose a generalized graph alignment formulation that considers both matches and mismatches in a standard QAP formulation. This modification can have a major impact in aligning graphs with different sizes and heterogeneous edge densities. Moreover, we propose two methods for solving the generalized graph alignment problem based on spectral decomposition of matrices. We compare the performance of proposed methods with some existing graph alignment algorithms including Natalie2, GHOST, IsoRank, NetAlign, Klau's approach as well as a semidefinite programming-based method over various synthetic and real graph models. Our proposed method based on simultaneous alignment of multiple eigenvectors leads to consistently good performance in different graph models. In particular, in the alignment of regular graph structures, which is one of the most difficult graph alignment cases, our proposed method significantly outperforms other methods.},

	abstract = {Network cost and network security are two of many network parameters that are important to network users. While these two parameters have been separately considered in coded networks (networks that employ network coding), a joint investigation of them both has not been done yet to our knowledge, thus providing the motivation for this work. In this paper, we consider the situation where a set of messages is to be multi-casted across the network, and a known subset of these messages is of interest to a wiretapping adversary. The problem that we attempt to solve is to find a network coding scheme that has both a low network cost and a low probability of the wiretapper being able to retrieve all the messages of interest. We make use of random linear codes in anticipation for decentralized implementation of the scheme, and focus on the problem of finding the multicast subgraph. As an exact algorithmic solution is difficult, we propose two heuristic solutions, and compare their performances to traditional routing through a simulation study. Our results suggest that network coding can be more effective than routing for this low cost and secure data multicast problem, especially when the links are not easily tapped.},

However, concerns with the security of wireless video, in particular when only some of the users are entitled to the highest quality, have uncovered the need for a network coding scheme capable of ensuring different levels of confidentiality under stringent complexity requirements. We show that the triple goal of hierarchical fidelity levels, robustness against wireless packet loss and efficient security can be achieved by exploiting the algebraic structure of network coding. The key idea is to limit the encryption operations to a critical set of network coding coefficients in combination with multi-resolution video coding. Our contributions include an information-theoretic security analysis of the proposed scheme, a basic system architecture for hierarchical wireless video with network coding and simulation results.},

	abstract = {We consider multicasting using random linear network coding over a multihop wireless network in the bandwidth limited regime. We address the associated medium access problem and propose a scheduling technique that activates hyperarcs rather than links, as in classical scheduling approaches. We encapsulate the constraints on valid network configurations in a conflict graph model and formulate a joint optimization problem taking into account both the network coding subgraph and the schedule. Next, using Lagrangian relaxation, we decompose the overall problem into two subproblems, a multiple-shortest-paths problem and a maximum weighted stable set (MWSS) problem. We show that if we use a greedy heuristic for the MWSS part of the problem, the overall algorithm is completely distributed. We provide extensive simulation results for both the centralized optimal and the decentralized algorithms. The optimal algorithm improves performance by up to a factor of two over widely used techniques such as orthogonal or two-hop-constrained scheduling. The decentralized algorithm is shown to buy its distributed operation with some throughput losses. Experimental results on randomly generated networks suggest that these losses are not large. Finally, we study the power consumption of our scheme and quantify the tradeoff between power and bandwidth efficiency.},

Given the fundamentally different packet processing required by this new paradigm and the inflexibility of hardware, existing solutions are based on software.

	abstract = {We study the effect of the field size on the performance of random linear network coding for time division duplexing channels proposed in [1]. In particular, we study the case of a node broadcasting to several receivers. We show that the effect of the field size can be included in the transition probabilities of the Markov chain model of the system. Also, an improved upper bound on the mean number of coded packets required to decode M original data packets using random linear network coding is presented. This bound shows that even if the field size is 2, i.e. we perform XORs amongst randomly selected packets from the pool of M original ones, we will need on average at most M + 2 coded packets in order to decode. Thus, there will be only a very small degradation in performance if M is large. We present numerical results showing that the mean completion time of our scheme with a field size of 2 is close in performance to our scheme when we use larger field sizes. We also show that as M increases, the difference between using a field size of 2 and larger field sizes decreases. Finally, we show that we can get very close to the optimal performance with small field sizes, e.g. a field size of 4 or 8, even when M is not very large.},

	abstract = {A new random linear network coding scheme for reliable communications for time division duplexing channels is proposed. The setup assumes a packet erasure channel and that nodes cannot transmit and receive information simultaneously. The sender transmits coded data packets back-to-back before stopping to wait for the receiver to acknowledge (ACK) the number of degrees of freedom, if any, that are required to decode correctly the information. We provide an analysis of this problem to show that there is an optimal number of coded data packets, in terms of mean completion time, to be sent before stopping to listen. This number depends on the latency, probabilities of packet erasure and ACK erasure, and the number of degrees of freedom that the receiver requires to decode the data. This scheme is optimal in terms of the mean time to complete the transmission of a fixed number of data packets. We show that its performance is very close to that of a full duplex system, while transmitting a different number of coded packets can cause large degradation in performance, especially if latency is high. Also, we study the throughput performance of our scheme and compare it to existing half-duplex go-back-N and selective repeat ARQ schemes. Numerical results, obtained for different latencies, show that our scheme has similar performance to the selective repeat in most cases and considerable performance gain when latency and packet error probability is high.},

	abstract = {There are three dominant contributing factors that distort short tandem repeat profile measurements, two of which, stutter and variations in the allelic peak heights, have been described extensively. Here we characterise the remaining component, baseline noise. A probabilistic characterisation of the non-allelic noise peaks is not only inherently useful for statistical inference but is also significant for establishing a detection threshold. We do this by analysing the data from 643 single person profiles for the Identifiler Plus kit and 303 for the PowerPlex 16 HS kit. This investigation reveals that although the dye colour is a significant factor, it is not sufficient to have a per-dye colour description of the noise. Furthermore, we show that at a per-locus basis, out of the Gaussian, log-normal, and gamma distribution classes, baseline noise is best described by log-normal distributions and provide a methodology for setting an analytical threshold based on that deduction. In the PowerPlex 16 HS kit, we observe evidence of significant stutter at two repeat units shorter than the allelic peak, which has implications for the definition of baseline noise and signal interpretation. In general, the DNA input mass has an influence on the noise distribution. Thus, it is advisable to study noise and, consequently, to infer quantities like the analytical threshold from data with a DNA input mass comparable to the DNA input mass of the samples to be analysed.},

Here, an analyst is allowed to reconstruct (in a mean-squared error sense) certain functions of the data (utility), while other private functions should not be reconstructed with distortion below a certain threshold (privacy). We demonstrate how chi-square information captures the fundamental PUT in this case and provide bounds for the best PUT. We propose a convex program to compute privacy-assuring mappings when the functions to be disclosed and hidden are known a priori and the data distribution is known. We derive lower bounds on the minimum mean-squared error of estimating a target function from the disclosed data and evaluate the robustness of our approach when an empirical distribution is used to compute the privacy-assuring mappings instead of the true data distribution.

The PICs lie in the intersection of information and estimation theory, and provide a fine-grained decomposition of the dependence between X and Y. Moreover, the PICs describe which functions of X can or cannot be reliably inferred (in terms of MMSE), given an observation of Y. We demonstrate that the PICs play an important role in information theory, and they can be used to characterize information-theoretic limits of certain estimation problems. In privacy settings, we prove that the PICs are related to the fundamental limits of perfect privacy.},

@inproceedings{Angelopoulos2014,
	abstract = {This paper proposes a partial packet recovery scheme, called Packetized Rateless Algebraic Consistency (PRAC). PRAC exploits intra and inter-packet consistency to identify and recover erroneous packet segments, without recourse to cross-layer or detailed feedback information. In the absence of cross-layer coordination or detailed feedback, the prevailing methods proposed in the literature have discarded packets with errors. PRAC uses a rateless linear packet code for data encoding and an iterative decoding process consisting of a search algorithm and an algebraic consistency rule (ACR) check. It allows, but not relies upon, the use of any PHY FEC code, requires no feedback other than a notification of completion and, in the absence of partial packets, incurs no overhead. Our implementation and experimental results in a 7-node indoor testbed using wireless boards equipped with CC2500 radio transceivers reveal that PRAC offers an average throughput gain of 35\% compared to a baseline ARQ scheme discarding partial packets and 13\% compared to an ideal genie-aided HARQ (iHARQ) scheme. Specifically for links with high PERs, PRAC significantly enhances their robustness and its maximum throughput gain is 148\% and 34\% compared against the baseline and iHARQ schemes, respectively.},

@misc{Medard2022,
	abstract = {In the classic wiretap model, Alice wishes to reliably communicate to Bob without being overheard by Eve who is eavesdropping over a degraded channel. Systems for achieving that physical layer security often rely on an error correction code whose rate is below the Shannon capacity of Alice and Bob's channel, so Bob can reliably decode, but above Alice and Eve's, so Eve cannot reliably decode. For the finite block length regime, several metrics have been proposed to characterise information leakage. Here we assess a new metric, the success exponent, and demonstrate it can be operationalized through the use of Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) to compromise the physical-layer security of any moderate length code. Success exponents are the natural beyond-capacity analogue of error exponents that characterise the probability that a maximum likelihood decoding is correct when the code-rate is above Shannon capacity, which is exponentially decaying in the code-length. Success exponents can be used to approximately evaluate the frequency with which Eve's decoding is correct in beyond-capacity channel conditions. Through the use of GRAND, we demonstrate that Eve can constrain her decoding procedure so that when she does identify a decoding, it is correct with high likelihood, significantly compromising Alice and Bob's communication by truthfully revealing a proportion of it. We provide general mathematical expressions for the determination of success exponents as well as for the evaluation of Eve's query number threshold, using the binary symmetric channel as a worked example. As GRAND algorithms are code-book agnostic and can decode any code structure, we provide empirical results for Random Linear Codes as exemplars. Simulation results demonstrate the practical possibility of compromising physical layer security.},

PPP designates a different restoration path for every link failure on each primary path. PPP also allows reuse of operational segments of the original primary path in the protection path. A novel approach used in this paper is that of a dynamic call-by-call model with blocking probability as the performance metric, this model is in contrast with traditional capacity-efficiency measurement for batch call arrivals. Additionally, we show that a simple method based on shortest path routing for which primary paths are selected first is more effective than a greedy approach that minimizes, for each call arrival, the number of wavelengths used by the primary and backup path jointly.},

@article{Duffy2022,
	abstract = {Error correction techniques traditionally focus on the co-design of restricted code-structures in tandem with code-specific decoders that are computationally efficient when decoding long codes in hardware. Modern applications are, however, driving demand for ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), rekindling interest in the performance of shorter, higher-rate error correcting codes, and raising the possibility of revisiting universal, code-agnostic decoders. To that end, here we introduce a soft-detection variant of Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) called Ordered Reliability Bits GRAND that can accurately decode any moderate redundancy block-code. It is designed with efficient circuit implementation in mind, and determines accurate decodings while retaining the original hard detection GRAND algorithm's suitability for a highly parallelized implementation in hardware. ORBGRAND is shown to provide excellent soft decision block error performance for codes of distinct classes (BCH, CA-Polar and RLC) with modest complexity, while providing better block error rate performance than CA-SCL, a state of the art soft detection CA-Polar decoder. ORBGRAND offers the possibility of an accurate, energy efficient soft detection decoder suitable for delivering URLLC in a single hardware realization.},

We distinguish between two types of traffic, namely elastic and inelastic, where the elasticity of a flow is based on the delay constraints associated with it. This novel formulation is useful in that it allows for the modeling of real-time traffic more accurately. Considering the limited availability of feedback in such systems, we focus on strategies with minimal acknowledgement requirements. Under both traffic types, we provide an extensive analysis of the gains of network coding as compared to traditional transmission strategies in a single-hop setting, and show that the gains are significant in general and can be considerably large in some cases. We further provide a method for realizing these gains in multi-hop networks with general topologies using the analysis of the single hop scenario.},

As a consequence, transmission bandwidth depends on the transmission distance, a feature that distinguishes an underwater acoustic system from a terrestrial radio system. The exact relationship between power, transmission band, distance and capacity for the Gaussian noise scenario is a complicated one. This work provides a closed-form approximate model for (1) power consumption, (2) band-edge frequency and (3) bandwidth as functions of distance and capacity required for a data link. This approximate model is obtained by numerical evaluation of analytical results which takes into account physical models of acoustic propagation loss and ambient noise.

We also propose a signaling scheme that is near-capacity achieving in this regime. We compute the error probability for this wideband noncoherent MIMO channel and study its dependence on SNR, number of transmit and receive antennas and coherence length. We show that error probability decays inversely with coherence length and exponentially with the product of the number of transmit and receive antennas.

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider different aspects of the problem of compressing for function computation across a network, which we call network functional compression. In network functional compression, computation of a function (or, some functions) of sources located at certain nodes in a network is desired at receiver(s). The rate region of this problem has been considered in the literature under certain restrictive assumptions, particularly in terms of the network topology, the functions, and the characteristics of the sources. In this paper, we present results that significantly relax these assumptions. For a one-stage tree network, we characterize a rate region by introducing a necessary and sufficient condition for any achievable coloring-based coding scheme called coloring connectivity condition. We also propose a modularized coding scheme based on graph colorings to perform arbitrarily closely to rate lower bounds. For a general tree network, we provide a rate lower bound based on graph entropies and show that, this bound is tight in the case of having independent sources. In particular, we show that, in a general tree network case with independent sources, to achieve the rate lower bound, intermediate nodes should perform computations. However, for a family of functions and random variables, which we call chain-rule proper sets, it is sufficient to have no computations at intermediate nodes to perform arbitrarily closely to the rate lower bound. In addition, we consider practical issues of coloring-based coding schemes and propose an efficient algorithm to compute a minimum entropy coloring of a characteristic graph under some conditions on source distributions and/or the desired function. Finally, extensions of these results for cases of having feedback and lossy function computations are discussed.},

@inproceedings{Makhdoumi2015,
	abstract = {With the boom of big data, traditional source coding techniques face the common obstacle to decode only a small portion of information efficiently. In this paper, we aim to resolve this difficulty by introducing a specific type of source coding scheme called locally decodable source coding (LDSC). Rigorously, LDSC is capable of recovering an arbitrary bit of the unencoded message from its encoded version, by only feeding a small number of the encoded message to the decoder, and we call the decoder t-local if only t encoded symbols are required.We consider both almost lossless (block error) and lossy (bit error) cases for LDSC. First, we show that using linear encoder and a decoder with bounded locality, the reliable compress rate can not be less than one. More importantly, we show that even with a general encoder and 2-local decoders (t = 2), the rate of LDSC is still one. On the contrary, the achievability bounds for almost lossless and lossy compressions with excess distortion suggest that optimal compression rate is achievable when O(log n) encoded symbols is queried by the decoder with block-length n. We also show that, rate distortion is achievable when the number of queries is scaled over n with a bound on the rate in finite-length regime. Although the achievability bounds are simply based on the concatenation of code blocks, they outperform the existing bounds in succinct data structures literature.},

	abstract = {Random linear network coding can be used in peerto- peer networks to increase the efficiency of content distribution and distributed storage. However, these systems are particularly susceptible to Byzantine attacks. We quantify the impact of Byzantine attacks on the coded system by evaluating the probability that a receiver node fails to correctly recover a file. We show that even for a small probability of attack, the system fails with overwhelming probability. We then propose a novel signature scheme that allows packet-level Byzantine detection. This scheme allows one-hop containment of the contamination, and saves bandwidth by allowing nodes to detect and drop the contaminated packets. We compare the net cost of our signature scheme with various other Byzantine schemes, and show that when the probability of Byzantine attacks is high, our scheme is the most bandwidth efficient.},

	abstract = {Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) provides a theoretically efficient method for coding. The drawbacks associated with it are the complexity of the decoding and the overhead resulting from the encoding vector. Increasing the field size and generation length presents a fundamental trade-off between packet-based throughput and operational overhead. On the one hand, decreasing the probability of redundant packets' being transmitted is beneficial for throughput and, consequently, reduces transmission energy. On the other hand, the decoding complexity and amount of header overhead increase with field size and generation length, leading to higher energy consumption. The main findings of this work are bounds for the transmission overhead due to linearly dependent packets. The optimal trade-off is system and topology dependent, as it depends on the cost in energy of performing coding operations versus transmitting data. We show that moderate field sizes are the correct choice when trade-offs are considered. The results show that sparse binary codes perform the best, unless the generation size is very low.},

@article{Luo2005,
	abstract = {In the wideband limit, certain types of  flash  signaling, such as flash frequency-shift keying (FSK), achieve the capacity of multipath fading channels. It is not clear, however, whether these asymptotic results translate into insights for practical fading channels in the finite-bandwidth, power-limited regime. It is known that, for flash FSK, the size of the input alphabet grows slowly with increasing bandwidth, leading to very high-peak power per tone. Thus, for flash FSK, the codeword probability of error decays very slowly with bandwidth and feasible rates approach the wideband capacity limit extremely slowly. Without contradicting the above results, our results in this paper point to a more optimistic outlook, from the point of view of error exponents and achievable rates, for the applicability of flash techniques in practical scenarios. We consider multitone FSK (MFSK), which has the same asymptotic capacity-achieving property as flash FSK in the wideband limit, but allows a larger input alphabet size with the same bandwidth. First, we show, using an error exponent approach, that multitone FSK allows lower peak power per tone than flash FSK. Next, we present the capacity of single-tone and two-tone FSK schemes with hard-decision detection at finite bandwidths. For typical channel parameters, the capacities are close to the wideband capacity limit.},

@article{Feizi2019,
	abstract = {Several significant models have been developed that enable the study of diffusion of signals across biological, social and engineered networks. Within these established frameworks, the inverse problem of identifying the source of the propagated signal is challenging, owing to the numerous alternative possibilities for signal progression through the network. In real world networks, the challenge of determining sources is compounded as the true propagation dynamics are typically unknown, and when they have been directly measured, they rarely conform to the assumptions of any of the well-studied models. In this paper we introduce a method called Network Infusion (NI) that has been designed to circumvent these issues, making source inference practical for large, complex real world networks. The key idea is that to infer the source node in the network, full characterization of diffusion dynamics, in many cases, may not be necessary. This objective is achieved by creating a diffusion kernel that well-approximates standard diffusion models such as the susceptible-infected diffusion model, but lends itself to inversion, by design, via likelihood maximization or error minimization. We apply NI for both single-source and multi-source diffusion, for both single-snapshot and multi-snapshot observations, and for both homogeneous and heterogeneous diffusion setups. We prove the mean-field optimality of NI for different scenarios, and demonstrate its effectiveness over several synthetic networks. Moreover, we apply NI to a real-data application, identifying news sources in the Digg social network, and demonstrate the effectiveness of NI compared to existing methods. Finally, we propose an integrative source inference framework that combines NI with a distance centrality-based method, which leads to a robust performance in cases where the underlying dynamics are unknown.},

	abstract = {We propose a mechanism that incorporates network coding into TCP with only minor changes to the protocol stack, thereby allowing incremental deployment. In our scheme, the source transmits random linear combinations of packets currently in the congestion window. At the heart of our scheme is a new interpretation of ACKs - the sink acknowledges every degree of freedom (i.e., a linear combination that reveals one unit of new information) even if it does not reveal an original packet immediately. Such ACKs enable a TCP-compatible sliding-window approach to network coding. Our scheme has the nice property that packet losses are essentially masked from the congestion control algorithm. Our algorithm therefore reacts to packet drops in a smooth manner, resulting in a novel and effective approach for congestion control over networks involving lossy links such as wireless links. Our scheme also allows intermediate nodes to perform re-encoding of the data packets. Our simulations show that our algorithm, with or without re-encoding inside the network, achieves much higher throughput compared to TCP over lossy wireless links. We also establish the soundness and fairness properties of our algorithm. Finally, we present queuing analysis for the case of intermediate node re-encoding.},

	abstract = {The advent of network coding promises to change many aspects of networking. Network coding moves away from the classical approach of networking, which treats networks as akin to physical transportation systems. We overview some of the main features of network coding that are most relevant to wireless networks. In particular, we discuss the fact that random distributed network coding is asymptotically optimal for wireless networks with and without packet erasures. These results are extremely general and allow packet loss correlation, such as may occur in fading wireless channels. The coded network lends itself, for multicast connections, to a cost optimization which not only outperforms traditional routing tree-based approaches, but also lends itself to a distributed implementation and to a dynamic implementation when changing conditions, such as mobility, arise. We illustrate the performance of such optimization methods for energy efficiency in wireless networks and propose some new directions for research in the area.},

	abstract = {Multi-resolution codes enable multicast at different rates to different receivers, a setup that is often desirable for graphics or video streaming. We propose a simple, distributed, two-stage message passing algorithm to generate network codes for single-source multicast of multi-resolution codes. The goal of this pushback algorithm is to maximize the total rate achieved by all receivers, while guaranteeing decodability of the base layer at each receiver. By conducting pushback and code assignment stages, this algorithm takes advantage of inter-layer as well as intra-layer coding. Numerical simulations show that in terms of total rate achieved, the pushback algorithm outperforms routing and intra-layer coding schemes, even with field sizes as small as 2{\textasciicircum}10(10 bits). In addition, the performance gap widens as the number of receivers and the number of nodes in the network increases. We also observe that naive inter-layer coding schemes may perform worse than intra-layer schemes under certain network conditions.},

@article{Hansen2015,
	abstract = {Software defined networking has garnered large attention due to its potential to virtualize services in the Internet, introducing flexibility in the buffering, scheduling, processing, and routing of data in network routers. SDN breaks the deadlock that has kept Internet network protocols stagnant for decades, while applications and physical links have evolved. This article advocates for the use of SDN to bring about 5G network services by incorporating network coding (NC) functionalities. The latter constitutes a major leap forward compared to the state-ofthe- art store and forward Internet paradigm. The inherent flexibility of both SDN and NC provides fertile ground to envision more efficient, robust, and secure networking designs, which may also incorporate content caching and storage, all of which are key challenges of the upcoming 5G networks. This article not only proposes the fundamentals of this intersection, but also supports it with key use cases and a thorough performance evaluation on an implementation that integrated the Kodo library (NC) into OpenFlow (SDN). Our results on singlehop, multihop, and multi-path scenarios show that gains of 3x to 11x are attainable over standard TCP and multi-path TCP.},

We first present empirical data to help understand the mobile environment when three heterogeneous networks are available to the mobile device (i.e., a WiFi network, WiMax network, and an Iridium satellite network). We then propose a reliable, multi-path protocol called Multi-Path TCP with Network Coding (MPTCP/NC) that utilizes each of these networks in parallel. An analytical model is developed and a mean-field approximation is derived that gives an estimate of the protocol's achievable throughput. Finally, a comparison between MPTCP and MPTCP/NC is presented using both the empirical data and mean-field approximation. Our results show that network coding can provide users in mobile environments a higher quality of service by enabling the use of multiple network technologies and the capability to overcome packet losses due to lossy, wireless network connections.},

	abstract = {The capability of mobile devices to use multiple interfaces to support a single session is becoming more prevalent. Prime examples include the desire to implement WiFi offloading and the introduction of 5G. Furthermore, an increasing fraction of Internet traffic is becoming delay sensitive. These two trends drive the need to investigate methods that enable communication over multiple parallel heterogeneous networks, while also ensuring that delay constraints are met. This paper approaches these challenges using a multi-path streaming code that uses forward error correction to reduce the in-order delivery delay of packets in networks with poor link quality and transient connectivity. A simple analysis is developed that provides a good approximation of the in-order delivery delay. Furthermore, numerical results help show that the delay penalty of communicating over multiple paths is insignificant when considering the potential throughput gains obtained through the fusion of multiple networks.},

	abstract = {One of the main challenges in containing the Coronoavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic stems from the difficulty in carrying out efficient mass diagnosis over large populations. The leading method to test for COVID-19 infection utilizes qualitative polymerase chain reaction, implemented using dedicated machinery which can simultaneously process a limited amount of samples. A candidate method to increase the test throughput is to examine pooled samples comprised of a mixture of samples from different patients. In this work we study pooling-based COVID-19 tests. We identify the specific requirements of COVID-19 testing, including the need to characterize the infection level and to operate in a one-shot fashion, which limit the application of traditional group-testing (GT) methods. We then propose a multi-level GT scheme, designed specifically to meet the unique requirements of COVID-19 tests, while exploiting the strength of GT theory to enable accurate recovery using much fewer tests than patients. Our numerical results demonstrate that multi-level GT reliably and efficiently detects the infection levels, while achieving improved accuracy over previously proposed one-shot COVID-19 pooled-testing methods.},

	abstract = {In the simplest relaying strategy, a network node amplifies and forwards a received signal over a wireless channel. Multihop amplify-and-forward allows for a (noisy) linear combination of signals simultaneously sent from multiple sources to be propagated through the network over multiple layers of relays. The performance of multihop amplify-and-forward is limited by noise propagated to the destination over multiple hops, and we expect this strategy to perform well only in high SNR. In this paper, this intuition is formalized and high-SNR conditions under which multihop amplify-and-forward approaches capacity in a layered relay network are determined. By relating the received signal power and the received power of the propagated noise at the nodes, the rate achievable with multihop amplify-and-forward is determined. In particular, when all received powers are lower bounded by \$1/{\textbackslash}delta \$, the noise power propagated to the destination over \$L\$ layers is of the order \$L{\textbackslash}delta \$. The result demonstrates that multihop amplify-and-forward approaches the cut-set bound as received powers at relays increase. As all powers in the network increase at the same rate, the multihop amplify-and-forward rate and the upper bound are within a gap that is independent of channel gains. This gap grows linearly with the number of nodes.},

	abstract = {We analyze the performance of TCP and TCP with network coding (TCP/NC) in lossy wireless networks. We build upon the simple framework introduced by Padhye et al. and characterize the throughput behavior of classical TCP as well as TCP/NC as a function of erasure rate, round-trip time, maximum window size, and duration of the connection. Our analytical results show that network coding masks erasures and losses from TCP, thus preventing TCP's performance degradation in lossy networks, such as wireless networks. It is further seen that TCP/NC has significant throughput gains over TCP. In addition, we simulate TCP and TCP/NC to verify our analysis of the average throughput and the window evolution. Our analysis and simulation results show very close concordance and support that TCP/NC is robust against erasures. TCP/NC is not only able to increase its window size faster but also to maintain a large window size despite losses within the network, whereas TCP experiences window closing essentially because losses are mistakenly attributed to congestion.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of establishing minimum-cost multicast connections over coded packet networks, i.e., packet networks where the contents of outgoing packets are arbitrary, causal functions of the contents of received packets. We consider both wireline and wireless packet networks as well as both static multicast (where membership of the multicast group remains constant for the duration of the connection) and dynamic multicast (where membership of the multicast group changes in time, with nodes joining and leaving the group). For static multicast, we reduce the problem to a polynomial-time solvable optimization problem, and we present decentralized algorithms for solving it. These algorithms, when coupled with existing decentralized schemes for constructing network codes, yield a fully decentralized approach for achieving minimum-cost multicast. By contrast, establishing minimum-cost static multicast connections over routed packet networks is a very difficult problem even using centralized computation, except in the special cases of unicast and broadcast connections. For dynamic multicast, we reduce the problem to a dynamic programming problem and apply the theory of dynamic programming to suggest how it may be solved.},

	abstract = {Most medium access control (MAC) mechanisms discard collided packets and consider interference harmful. Recent work on Analog Network Coding (ANC) suggests a different approach, in which multiple interfering transmissions are strategically scheduled. Receiving nodes collect the results of collisions and then use a decoding process, such as ZigZag decoding, to extract the packets involved in the collisions. In this paper, we present an algebraic representation of collisions and describe a general approach to recovering collisions using ANC. To study the effects of using ANC on the performance of MAC layers, we develop an ANC-based MAC algorithm, CMAC, and analyze its performance in terms of probabilistic latency guarantees for local packet delivery. Specifically, we prove that CMAC implements an abstract MAC layer service, as defined in [14, 13]. This study shows that ANC can significantly improve the performance of the abstract MAC layer service compared to conventional probabilistic transmission approaches. We illustrate how this improvement in the MAC layer can translate into faster higher-level algorithms, by analyzing the time complexity of a multi-message network-wide broadcast algorithm that uses CMAC.},

@article{Coleman2006,
	abstract = {This paper discusses the Slepian-Wolf problem of distributed near-lossless compression of correlated sources. We introduce practical new tools for communicating at all rates in the achievable region. The technique employs a simple  source-splitting  strategy that does not require common sources of randomness at the encoders and decoders. This approach allows for pipelined encoding and decoding so that the system operates with the complexity of a single user encoder and decoder. Moreover, when this splitting approach is used in conjunction with iterative decoding methods, it produces a significant simplification of the decoding process. We demonstrate this approach for synthetically generated data. Finally, we consider the Slepian-Wolf problem when linear codes are used as syndrome-formers and consider a linear programming relaxation to maximum-likelihood (ML) sequence decoding. We note that the fractional vertices of the relaxed polytope compete with the optimal solution in a manner analogous to that observed when the  min-sum  iterative decoding algorithm is applied. This relaxation exhibits the ML-certificate property: if an integral solution is found, it is the ML solution. For symmetric binary joint distributions, we show that selecting easily constructable  expander -style low-density parity check codes (LDPCs) as syndrome-formers admits a positive error exponent and therefore provably good performance},

	abstract = {We examine the issue of separation and code design for network data transmission environments. We demonstrate that source-channel sep-aration holds for several canonical network channel models when the whole network operates over a common finite field. Our approach uses linear codes. This simple, unifying framework allows us to re-establish with economy the optimality of linear codes for single transmitter channels and for Slepian-Wolf source coding. It also enables us to establish the optimality of linear codes for multiple access channels and for erasure broadcast channels. Moreover, we show that source-channel separation holds for these networks. This robustness of separation we show to be strongly predicated on the fact that noise and inputs are independent. The linearity of source, channel, and network coding blurs the delineation between these codes, and thus we explore joint linear de-sign. Finally, we illustrate the fact that design for individual network modules may yield poor results when such modules are concatenated, demonstrating that end-to-end coding is necessary. Thus, we argue, it is the lack of decomposability into canonical network modules, rather than the lack of separation between source and channel coding, that presents major challenges for coding in networks.},

@article{An2022a,
	abstract = {While many communications media, such as wireless and certain classes of wireline channels, typically lead to bursty errors, most decoders are designed assuming memoryless channels. Consequently, communication systems generally rely on interleaving over tens of thousands of bits to match decoder assumptions. Even for short high rate codes, awaiting sufficient data in interleaving and de-interleaving is a significant source of unwanted latency. We construct an extension to the recently proposed Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) algorithm, which we call GRAND-MO for GRAND Markov Order. By foregoing interleaving and instead making use of the bursty nature of noise, low-latency communication is possible with block error rates outperforming their interleaved counterparts by a substantial margin. We establish that certain well-known binary codes with structured code-word patterns are ill-suited for use in bursty channels, but Random Linear Codes (RLCs) prove robust to correlated noise. We further demonstrate that by operating directly on modulated symbols rather than de-mapped bits, GRAND-MO achieves further performance and complexity gains by exploiting information that is lost in demodulation. As a result, GRAND-MO provides one potential solution for applications that require ultra-reliable low latency communication.},

When multiple signals are sampled, the spatial correlation between them may be utilized to reduce the overall reconstruction error. In this work we study joint sampling and reconstruction of multiple correlated stochastic sources, exploiting their correlation to improve recovery. We derive the achievable reconstruction error and the corresponding sampling system for arbitrary sampling rates and spectral structures. The proposed system minimizes the error when sampling below the Nyquist rate by preserving only the most dominant spatial eigenmodes aliased to each frequency. Using this characterization, we obtain sufficient conditions for error free recovery. We also discuss a distributed sampling setting, where each signal is acquired separately, while reconstruction is performed jointly. We characterize conditions under which distributed sampling performs as well as joint sampling. Our numerical results illustrate that joint sampling can achieve negligible reconstruction error using low sampling rates when the signals exhibit notable spatial correlation, and demonstrate that properly exploiting this correlation can dramatically improve reconstruction accuracy.},

	abstract = {Throughput and per-packet delay can present strong trade-offs that are important in the cases of delay sensitive applications. We investigate such trade-offs using a random linear network coding scheme for one or more receivers in single hop wireless packet erasure broadcast channels. We capture the delay sensitivities across different types of network applications using a class of delay metrics based on the norms of packet arrival times. With these delay metrics, we establish a unified framework to characterize the rate and delay requirements of applications and to optimize system parameters. In the single receiver case, we demonstrate the trade-off between average packet delay, which we view as the inverse of throughput, and maximum inorder inter-arrival delay for various system parameters. For a single broadcast channel with multiple receivers having different delay constraints and feedback delays, we jointly optimize the coding parameters and time-division scheduling parameters at the transmitter. We formulate the optimization problem as a Generalized Geometric Program (GGP). This approach allows the transmitter to adjust adaptively the coding and scheduling parameters for efficient allocation of network resources under varying delay constraints. In the case where the receivers are served by multiple non-interfering wireless broadcast channels, the same optimization problem is formulated as a Signomial Program, which is NP-hard in general. We provide approximation methods using successive formulation of geometric programs and show the convergence of approximations.},

These results shifted focus away from creating code-independent decoders, but recent low-latency communication applications necessitate relatively short codes, providing motivation to reconsider the development of universal decoders. We introduce a scheme for employing binarized symbol soft information within Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding, a universal hard detection decoder. We incorporate codebook-independent quantization of soft information to indicate demodulated symbols to be reliable or unreliable. We introduce two decoding algorithms: one identifies a conditional Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding; the other either reports a conditional ML decoding or an error. For random codebooks, we present error exponents and asymptotic complexity, and show benefits over hard detection. As empirical illustrations, we compare performance with majority logic decoding of Reed-Muller codes, with Berlekamp-Massey decoding of Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem codes, with CA-SCL decoding of CA-Polar codes, and establish the performance of Random Linear Codes, which require a universal decoder and offer a broader palette of code sizes and rates than traditional codes.},

GRAND has the unusual property that its complexity decreases as code-book rate increases. Here we provide an extension to GRAND, soft-GRAND (SGRAND), that incorporates soft detection symbol reliability information and identifies a ML decoding in that context. In particular, we assume symbols received from the channel are declared to be error free or to have been potentially subject to additive noise. SGRAND inherits desirable properties of GRAND, including being capacity achieving when used with random code-books, and having a complexity that reduces as the code-rate increases.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new algorithm for Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding for channels with memory. The algorithm is based on the principle that the receiver rank orders noise sequences from most likely to least likely. Subtracting noise from the received signal in that order, the first instance that results in an element of the code-book is the ML decoding. In contrast to traditional approaches, this novel scheme has the desirable property that it becomes more efficient as the code-book rate increases. We establish that the algorithm is capacity achieving for randomly selected code-books. When the code-book rate is less than capacity, we identify asymptotic error exponents as the block length becomes large. When the code-book rate is beyond capacity, we identify asymptotic success exponents. We determine properties of the complexity of the scheme in terms of the number of computations the receiver must perform per block symbol. Worked examples are presented for binary memoryless and Markovian noise. These demonstrate that block-lengths that offer a good complexity-rate tradeoff are typically smaller than the reciprocal of the bit error rate.},

	abstract = {Current means of providing loop-back recovery, which is widely used in SONET, rely on ring topologies, or on overlaying logical ring topologies upon physical meshes. Loop-back is desirable to provide rapid preplanned recovery of link or node failures in a bandwidth-efficient distributed manner. We introduce generalized loop-back, a novel scheme for performing loop-back in optical mesh networks. We present an algorithm to perform recovery for link failure and one to perform generalized loop-back recovery for node failure. We illustrate the operation of both algorithms, prove their validity, and present a network management protocol algorithm, which enables distributed operation for link or node failure. We present three different applications of generalized loop-back. First, we present heuristic algorithms for selecting recovery graphs, which maintain short maximum and average lengths of recovery paths. Second, we present WDM-based loop-back recovery for optical networks where wavelengths are used to back up other wavelengths. We compare, for WDM-based loop-back, the operation of generalized loop-back operation with known ring-based ways of providing loop-back recovery over mesh networks. Finally, we introduce the use of generalized loop-back to provide recovery in a way that allows dynamic choice of routes over preplanned directions.},

@article{Doshi2010,
	abstract = {Motivated by applications to sensor networks and privacy preserving databases, we consider the problem of functional compression. The objective is to separately compress possibly correlated discrete sources such that an arbitrary but fixed deterministic function of those sources can be computed given the compressed data from each source. We consider both the lossless and lossy computation of a function. Specifically, we present results of the rate regions for three instances of the problem where there are two sources: 1) lossless computation where one source is available at the decoder; 2) under a special condition, lossless computation where both sources are separately encoded; and 3) lossy computation where one source is available at the decoder. For all of these instances, we present a layered architecture for distributed coding: first preprocess data at each source using colorings of certain characteristic graphs and then use standard distributed source coding (a la Slepian and Wolfs scheme) to compress them. For the first instance, our results extend the approach developed by Orlitsky and Roche (2001) in the sense that our scheme requires simpler structure of coloring rather than independent sets as in the previous case. As an intermediate step to obtain these results, we obtain an asymptotic characterization of conditional graph coloring for an OR product of graphs generalizing a result of Korner (1973), which should be of interest in its own right.},

	abstract = {We focus on the privacy-utility trade-off encountered by users who wish to disclose some information to an analyst, that is correlated with their private data, in the hope of receiving some utility. We rely on a general privacy statistical inference framework, under which data is transformed before it is disclosed, according to a probabilistic privacy mapping. We show that when the log-loss is introduced in this framework in both the privacy metric and the distortion metric, the privacy leakage and the utility constraint can be reduced to the mutual information between private data and disclosed data, and between non-private data and disclosed data respectively. We justify the relevance and generality of the privacy metric under the log-loss by proving that the inference threat under any bounded cost function can be upperbounded by an explicit function of the mutual information between private data and disclosed data. We then show that the privacy-utility tradeoff under the log-loss can be cast as the non-convex Privacy Funnel optimization, and we leverage its connection to the Information Bottleneck, to provide a greedy algorithm that is locally optimal. We evaluate its performance on the US census dataset. Finally, we characterize the optimal privacy mapping for the Gaussian Privacy Funnel.},

We also investigate the results of its synergy with forward error correction (FEC) codes at the PHY-layer in a joint channel-network coding (JCNC) scheme. RLNC is an emerging coding technique which can be used as a packet-level erasure code, usually implemented at the network layer, which increases data reliability against channel fading and severe interference, while FEC codes are mainly used for correction of random bit errors within a received packet. The hostile wireless environment that low power sensors usually operate in, with significant interference from nearby networks, motivates us to consider a joint coding scheme and examine the applicability of RLNC as an erasure code in such a coding structure. Our analysis and experiments are performed using a custom low power sensor node, which integrates on-chip a low-power 2.4 GHz transmitter and an accelerator implementing a multi-rate convolutional code and RLNC, in a typical office environment. According to measurement results, RLNC of code rate 4/8 can provide an effective SNR improvement of about 3.4 dB, outperforming a PHY-layer FEC code of the same code rate, at a PER of 10-2. In addition, RLNC performs very well when used in conjunction with a PHY-layer FEC code as a JCNC scheme, offering an overall coding gain of 5.6 dB.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we provide theoretical and simulation-based study of the delivery delay performance of a number of existing throughput-optimal coding schemes and use the results to design a new dynamic rate adaptation scheme that achieves improved overall throughput-delay performance. Under a baseline rate control scheme, the receivers' delay performance is examined. Based on their Markov states, the knowledge difference between the sender and receiver, three distinct methods for packet delivery are identified: zero state, leader state, and coefficient-based delivery. We provide analyses of each of these and show that, in many cases, zero state delivery alone presents a tractable approximation of the expected packet delivery behavior. Interestingly, while coefficient-based delivery has so far been treated as a secondary effect in the literature, we find that the choice of coefficients is extremely important in determining the delay, and a well-chosen encoding scheme can, in fact, contribute a significant improvement to the delivery delay. Based on our delivery delay model, we develop a dynamic rate adaptation scheme that uses performance prediction models to determine the sender transmission rate. Surprisingly, taking this approach leads us to the simple conclusion that the sender should regulate its addition rate based on the total number of undelivered packets stored at the receivers. We show that despite its simplicity, our proposed dynamic rate adaptation scheme results in noticeably improved throughput-delay performance over existing schemes in the literature.},

	abstract = {We consider the distributed computation of a function of random sources with minimal communication. Specifically, given two discrete memoryless sources, X and Y, a receiver wishes to compute f(X, Y) based on (encoded) information sent from X and Y in a distributed manner. A special case, f(X, Y) = (X, Y), is the classical question of distributed source coding considered by Slepian and Wolf (1973). Orlitsky and Roche (2001) considered a somewhat restricted setup when Y is available as side information at the receiver. They characterized the minimal rate at which X needs to transmit data to the receiver as the conditional graph entropy of the characteristic graph of X based on f. In our recent work (2006), we further established that this minimal rate can be achieved by means of graph coloring and distributed source coding (e.g. Slepian-Wolf coding). This characterization allows for the separation between  function coding  and  correlation coding.  In this paper, we consider a more general setup where X and Y are both encoded (separately). This is a significantly harder setup for which to give a single-letter characterization for the complete rate region. We find that under a certain condition on the support set of X and Y (called the zigzag condition), it is possible to characterize the rate region based on graph colorings at X and Y separately. That is, any achievable pair of rates can be realized by means of first coloring graphs at X and Y separately (function coding) and then using Slepian-Wolf coding for these colors (correlation coding). We also obtain a single-letter characterization of the minimal joint rate. Finally, we provide simulation results based on graph coloring to establish the rate gains on real sequences},

We now address the design and analysis of OFS networks in a more comprehensive fashion. The contributions of this work, in particular, are in providing partial answers to the questions of how OFS networks can be implemented, how well they perform, and how their economics compare with those of other architectures. With respect to implementation, we present a sensible scheduling algorithm for inter-metropolitan-area-network (inter-MAN) OFS communication. Our performance study builds upon our work in IEEE J. Sel. Areas Commun., vol. 25, no. 6, pp. 84--101, 2007 and Weichenberg et al., ``Performance analysis of optical flow switching,'' presented at the IEEE International Conference on Communications, Dresden, Germany, June 14--18, 2009, and includes a comparative capacity analysis for the wide area, as well as an analytical approximation of the throughput-delay trade-off offered by OFS for inter-MAN communication. Last, with regard to the economics of OFS, we extend our previous work from ECOC 2006 and GLOBECOM '06 in carrying out an optimized throughput-cost comparison of OFS with other prominent candidate architectures. Our conclusions indicate that OFS offers a significant advantage over other architectures in economic scalability. In particular, for sufficiently heavy traffic, OFS handles large transactions at far lower cost than other optical network architectures. In light of the increasing importance of large transactions to communication networks, we conclude that OFS may be crucial to the future viability of optical networking.},

	abstract = {We study joint network and channel code design to optimize delay performance. Here the delay is the transmission time of information packets from a source to sinks without considering queuing effects. In our systems, network codes (network layer) are on top of channel codes (physical layer) which are disturbed by noise. Network codes run in a rateless random method, and thus have erasure-correction capability. For the constraint of finite transmission time, transmission errors are inevitable in the physical layer. A detection error in the physical layer means an erasure of network codewords. For the analysis, we model the delay of each information generation in the network layer as independent, identically distributed random variables. The calculation approaches for delay measures are investigated for coded erasure networks. We show how to evaluate the rate and erasure probability of a set of channels belonging to one cut. We also show that the min-cut determines the decoding error probability in the sinks if the number of information packets is large. We observe that for a given amount of source information, larger packet length leads to fewer packets to be transmitted but higher physical-layer detection error probabilities. Further, longer transmission time (delay) in the physical-layer causes smaller detection error probability at the physical layer. Thus, both parameters have opposite impacts on the physical and network layer, considering delay. We should find the optimal values of them in a cross-layer approach. We then formulate the problems of optimizing delay performance, and discuss solutions for them.},

	abstract = {CRC codes have long since been adopted in a vast range of applications. The established notion that they are suitable primarily for error detection can be set aside through use of the recently proposed Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND). Hard-detection (GRAND-SOS) and soft-detection (ORBGRAND) variants can decode any short, high-rate block code, making them suitable for error correction of CRC-coded data. When decoded with GRAND, short CRC codes have error correction capability that is at least as good as popular codes such as BCH codes, but with no restriction on either code length or rate.The state-of-the-art CA-Polar codes are concatenated CRC and Polar codes. For error correction, we find that the CRC is a better short code than either Polar or CA-Polar codes. Moreover, the standard CA-SCL decoder only uses the CRC for error detection and therefore suffers severe performance degradation in short, high rate settings when compared with the performance GRAND provides, which uses all of the CA-Polar bits for error correction.Using GRAND, existing systems can be upgraded from error detection to low-latency error correction without re-engineering the encoder, and additional applications of CRCs can be found in IoT, Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC), and beyond. The universality of GRAND, its ready parallelized implementation in hardware, and the good performance of CRC as codes make their combination a viable solution for low-latency applications.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we demonstrate some applications of compressive sensing over networks. We make a connection between compressive sensing and traditional information theoretic techniques in source coding and channel coding. Our results provide an explicit trade-off between the rate and the decoding complexity. The key difference of compressive sensing and traditional information theoretic approaches is at their decoding side. Although optimal decoders to recover the original signal, compressed by source coding have high complexity, the compressive sensing decoder is a linear or convex optimization. First, we investigate applications of compressive sensing on distributed compression of correlated sources. Here, by using compressive sensing, we propose a compression scheme for a family of correlated sources with a modularized decoder, providing a trade-off between the compression rate and the decoding complexity. We call this scheme Sparse Distributed Compression. We use this compression scheme for a general multicast network with correlated sources. Here, we first decode some of the sources by a network decoding technique and then, we use a compressive sensing decoder to obtain the whole sources. Then, we investigate applications of compressive sensing on channel coding. We propose a coding scheme that combines compressive sensing and random channel coding for a high-SNR point-to-point Gaussian channel. We call this scheme Sparse Channel Coding. We propose a modularized decoder providing a trade-off between the capacity loss and the decoding complexity. At the receiver side, first, we use a compressive sensing decoder on a noisy signal to obtain a noisy estimate of the original signal and then, we apply a traditional channel coding decoder to find the original signal.},

We present an analytical model to evaluate the performance of COPE in simple networks, and our results show the excellent predictive quality of this model. By closely examining the performance in two simple topologies, we observe that the coding gain results from the interaction between network coding and the MAC protocol, and the gap between the theoretical and practical gains is due to the different channel qualities of sending nodes. This understanding is helpful for design of larger mesh networks that use network coding.},

It has recently been shown that the significant engineering difference between the coherent and the noncoherent fading channels, including the requirement of peaky signaling and the resulting spectral efficiency, is determined by how the capacity limit is approached as SNR tends to zero, or in other words, the sublinear term in the capacity expression. In this paper, we show that this sublinear term is determined by the channel coherence level, which we define to quantify the relation between the SNR and the channel coherence time. This allows us to trace a continuum between the case with perfect CSIR and the case with no CSIR at all. Using this approach, we also evaluate the performance of suboptimal training schemes.},

	abstract = {In forensic DNA interpretation, the likelihood ratio (LR) is often used to convey the strength of a match. Expanding on binary and semi-continuous methods that do not use all of the quantitative data contained in an electropherogram, fully continuous methods to calculate the LR have been created. These fully continuous methods utilize all of the information captured in the electropherogram, including the peak heights. Recently, methods that calculate the distribution of the LR using semi-continuous methods have also been developed. The LR distribution has been proposed as a way of studying the robustness of the LR, which varies depending on the probabilistic model used for its calculation. For example, the LR distribution can be used to calculate the p-value, which is the probability that a randomly chosen individual results in a LR greater than the LR obtained from the person-of-interest (POI). Hence, the p-value is a statistic that is different from, but related to, the LR; and it may be interpreted as the false positive rate resulting from a binary hypothesis test between the prosecution and defense hypotheses. Here, we present CEESIt, a method that combines the twin features of a fully continuous model to calculate the LR and its distribution, conditioned on the defense hypothesis, along with an associated p-value. CEESIt incorporates dropout, noise and stutter (reverse and forward) in its calculation. As calibration data, CEESIt uses single source samples with known genotypes and calculates a LR for a specified POI on a question sample, along with the LR distribution and a p-value. The method was tested on 303 files representing 1-, 2- and 3-person samples injected using three injection times containing between 0.016 and 1ng of template DNA. Our data allows us to evaluate changes in the LR and p-value with respect to the complexity of the sample and to facilitate discussions regarding complex DNA mixture interpretation. We observed that the amount of template DNA from the contributor impacted the LR -- small LRs resulted from contributors with low template masses. Moreover, as expected, we observed a decrease of p-values as the LR increased. A p-value of 10−9 or lower was achieved in all the cases where the LR was greater than 108. We tested the repeatability of CEESIt by running all samples in duplicate and found the results to be repeatable.},

@article{Duffy2019a,
	abstract = {We introduce a new algorithm for realizing maximum likelihood (ML) decoding for arbitrary codebooks in discrete channels with or without memory, in which the receiver rank-orders noise sequences from most likely to least likely. Subtracting noise from the received signal in that order, the first instance that results in a member of the codebook is the ML decoding. We name this algorithm GRAND for Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding. We establish that GRAND is capacity-achieving when used with random codebooks. For rates below capacity, we identify error exponents, and for rates beyond capacity, we identify success exponents. We determine the scheme's complexity in terms of the number of computations that the receiver performs. For rates beyond capacity, this reveals thresholds for the number of guesses by which, if a member of the codebook is identified, that it is likely to be the transmitted code word. We introduce an approximate ML decoding scheme where the receiver abandons the search after a fixed number of queries, an approach we dub GRANDAB, for GRAND with ABandonment. While not an ML decoder, we establish that the algorithm GRANDAB is also capacity-achieving for an appropriate choice of abandonment threshold, and characterize its complexity, error, and success exponents. Worked examples are presented for Markovian noise that indicate these decoding schemes substantially outperform the brute force decoding approach.},

@article{Lumetta2000,
	abstract = {Link recovery in high-speed four-fiber networks can be achieved using dynamic searches, covers of rings, or generalized loopback. We present a method to provide link recovery for all links in a network without using all links for backup traffic transmission. The method extends generalized loopback to operate on a subgraph of the full backup graph. The backup capacity on such links can then be used to carry unprotected traffic, i.e., traffic that is not recovered in case of a failure, while primary fibers on the links retain failure protection. Although all primary fibers remain fully robust to single-link failures, reserving links for unprotected traffic reduces a network's ability to recover from multiple failures. We explore the tradeoff between capacity and robustness to two-link failures for several typical high-speed optical fiber networks, comparing the properties of three link-restoration algorithms based on generalized loopback with the properties of covers of rings. Our results demonstrate robustness comparable or superior to that available with covers of rings while providing an additional unprotected traffic capacity of roughly 20\% of the network's primary capacity.},

@article{Medard2004,
	abstract = {We study different notions of capacity for time-slotted ALOHA systems. In these systems, multiple users synchronously send packets in a bursty manner over a common additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. The users do not coordinate their transmissions, which may collide at the receiver. For such a system, we define both single-slot capacity and multiple-slot capacity. We then construct a coding and decoding scheme for single-slot capacity that achieves any rate within this capacity region. This coding and decoding scheme for a single time slot combines aspects of multiple access rate splitting and of broadcast codes for degraded AWGN channels. This design allows some bits to be reliably received even when collisions occur and more bits to be reliably received in the absence of collisions. The exact number of bits reliably received under both of these scenarios is part of the code design process, which we optimize to maximize the expected rate in each slot. Next, we examine the behavior of the system asymptotically over multiple slots. We show that there exist coding and decoding strategies such that regardless of the burstiness of the traffic, the system is stable as long as the average rate of the users is within the multiple access capacity region of the channel. In other words, we show that bursty traffic does not decrease the Cover-Wyner capacity region of the multiple access channel. A vast family of codes, which includes the type of codes we introduce for the single-slot transmission, achieve the capacity region, in a sense we define, for multiple-slot transmissions. These codes are stabilizing, using only local information at each of the individual queues. The use of information regarding other queues or the use of scheduling does not improve the multiple-slot capacity region.},

@article{Farsad2020,
	abstract = {This work introduces the particle-intensity channel (PIC) as a new model for molecular communication systems that includes imperfections at both transmitter and receiver and provides a new characterization of the capacity limits as well as properties of the optimal (capacity-achieving) input distributions for such channels. In the PIC, the transmitter encodes information, in symbols of a given duration, based on the probability of particle release, and the receiver detects and decodes the message based on the number of particles detected during the symbol interval. In this channel, the transmitter may be unable to control precisely the probability of particle release, and the receiver may not detect all the particles that arrive. We model this channel using a generalization of the binomial channel and show that the capacity-achieving input distribution for this channel always has mass points at probabilities of particle release of zero and one. To find the capacity-achieving input distributions, we develop a novel and efficient algorithm we call dynamic assignment Blahut-Arimoto (DAB). For diffusive particle transport, we also derive the conditions under which the input with two mass points is capacity-achieving.},

	abstract = {For data streaming applications, existing solutions are not yet able to close the gap between high data rates and low delay. This work considers the problem of data streaming under mixed delay constraints over a single communication channel with delayed feedback. We propose a novel layered adaptive causal random linear network coding (LAC-RLNC) approach with forward error correction. LAC-RLNC is a variable-to-variable coding scheme, i.e., variable recovered information data at the receiver over variable short block length and rate is proposed. Specifically, for data streaming with base and enhancement layers of content, we characterize a high dimensional throughput-delay trade-off managed by the adaptive causal layering coding scheme. The base layer is designed to satisfy the strict delay constraints, as it contains the data needed to allow the streaming service. Then, the sender can manage the throughput-delay trade-off of the second layer by adjusting the retransmission rate a priori and posterior as the enhancement layer, that contains the remaining data to augment the streaming service's quality, is with the relax delay constraints. We numerically show that the layered network coding approach can dramatically increase performance. We demonstrate that LAC-RLNC compared with the non-layered approach gains a factor of three in mean and maximum delay for the base layer, close to the lower bound, and factor two for the enhancement layer.},

	abstract = {Pilot symbol assisted modulation (PSAM) is a standard approach for transceiver design for time-varying channels, with channel estimates obtained from pilot symbols being employed for coherent demodulation of the data symbols. In this paper, we show that PSAM schemes can be improved by adapting the coded modulation strategy at the sender to the quality of the channel measurement at the receiver, without requiring any channel feedback from the receiver. We consider performance in terms of achievable rate for binary signaling schemes. The transmitter employs interleaved codes, with data symbols coded according to their distance from the nearest pilot symbols. Symbols far away from pilot symbols encounter poorer channel measurements at the receiver and are therefore coded with lower rate codes, while symbols close to pilot symbols benefit from recent channel measurements and are coded with higher rate codes. The performance benefits from this approach are quantified in the context of binary signaling over time-varying Rayleigh fading channels described by a Gauss-Markov model. The spacing of the pilot symbols is optimized to maximize the mutual information between input and output in this setting. Causal and noncausal channel estimators of varying complexity and delay are considered. It is shown that, by appropriate optimization for the spacing between consecutive pilot symbols, the adaptive coding techniques proposed can improve achievable rate, without any feedback from the receiver to the sender. Moreover, channel estimation based on the two closest pilot symbols is generally close to optimal.},

Capacity is achieved by coding over a network. We present a new framework for studying networks and their capacity. Our framework, based on algebraic methods, is surprisingly simple and effective. For networks which are restricted to using linear codes (we make the meaning of linear codes precise, since the codes are not bit-wise linear), we find necessary and sufficient conditions for any given set of connections to be achievable over a given network. For multicast connections, linear codes are not a restrictive assumption, since all achievable connections can be achieved using linear codes. Moreover, coding can be used to maintain connections after permanent failures, such as the removal of an edge from the network. We show necessary and sufficient conditions for a set of connections to be robust to a set of permanent failures. For multicast connections, we show the rather surprising result that, if a multicast connection is achievable under different failure scenarios, a single static code can ensure robustness of the connection under all of those failure scenarios.},

We characterize the optimal trade-off between these metrics as a function of system parameters such as the packet arrival rate and file size, for different channel models. In the first model, we assume packets arrive according to independent Poisson processes from multiple servers or peers. We use random linear network coding to simplify the packet requests at the network layer and avoid duplicate packet reception. This allows us to model the receiver's buffer as a queue with Poisson arrivals and deterministic departures. For this model, we show that for arrival rates slightly larger than the play rate, the minimum initial buffering required to achieve certain level of interruption probability remains bounded as the file size grows. This is not the case when the arrival rate and the play rate match. In the second model, we consider channels with memory, which can be modeled using Markovian arrival processes. We characterize the optimal trade-off curves for the infinite file size case, in such Markovian environments.},

	abstract = {Emulating a shared atomic, read/write storage system is a fundamental problem in distributed computing. Replicating atomic objects among a set of data hosts was the norm for traditional implementations (e.g., [11]) in order to guarantee the availability and accessibility of the data despite host failures. As replication is highly storage demanding, recent approaches suggested the use of erasure-codes to offer the same fault-tolerance while optimizing storage usage at the hosts. Initial works focused on a fixed set of data hosts. To guarantee longevity and scalability, a storage service should be able to dynamically mask hosts failures by allowing new hosts to join, and failed host to be removed without service interruptions. This work presents the first erasure-code -based atomic algorithm, called Ares, which allows the set of hosts to be modified in the course of an execution. Ares is composed of three main components: (i) a reconfiguration protocol, (ii) a read/write protocol, and (iii) a set of data access primitives (DAPs). The design of Ares is modular and is such to accommodate the usage of various erasure-code parameters on a per-configuration basis. We provide bounds on the latency of read/write operations and analyze the storage and communication costs of the Ares algorithm.},

	abstract = {A node performing analog network coding simply forwards a signal it receives over a wireless channel. This allows for a (noisy) linear combination of signals simultaneously sent from multiple sources to be forwarded in the network. As such, analog network coding extends the idea of network coding to wireless networks. However, the analog network coding performance is limited by propagated noise, and we expect this strategy to perform well only in high SNR. In this paper, we formalize this intuition and determine high-SNR conditions under which analog network coding approaches capacity in a layered relay network. By relating the received SNR at the nodes with the propagated noise, we determine the rate achievable with analog network coding. In particular, when all the received powers are lower bounded by 1/δ, the propagated noise power in a network with L layers is of the order Lδ. The result demonstrates that the analog network coding approaches the cut-set bound as the received powers at relays increase. As all powers in the network increase, the analog network coding rate is within a constant gap from the upper bound. The gap depends on number of nodes. We further demonstrate by an example that analog network coding can perform close to sum-capacity also in the multicast case.},

	abstract = {We present an information-theoretic framework for network management for recovery from nonergodic link failures. Building on recent work in the field of network coding, we describe the input-output relations of network nodes in terms of network codes. This very general concept of network behavior as a code provides a way to quantify essential management information as that needed to switch among different codes (behaviors) for different failure scenarios. We compare two types of recovery schemes, receiver-based and network-wide, and consider two formulations for quantifying network management. The first is a centralized formulation where network behavior is described by an overall code determining the behavior of every node, and the management requirement is taken as the logarithm of the number of such codes that the network may switch among. For this formulation, we give bounds, many of which are tight, on management requirements for various network connection problems in terms of basic parameters such as the number of source processes and the number of links in a minimum source-receiver cut. Our results include a lower bound for arbitrary connections and an upper bound for multitransmitter multicast connections, for linear receiver-based and network-wide recovery from all single link failures. The second is a node-based formulation where the management requirement is taken as the sum over all nodes of the logarithm of the number of different behaviors for each node. We show that the minimum node-based requirement for failures of links adjacent to a single receiver is achieved with receiver-based schemes.},

	abstract = {We propose a secure scheme for wireless network coding, called the algebraic watchdog. By enabling nodes to detect malicious behaviors probabilistically and use overheard messages to police their downstream neighbors locally, the algebraic watchdog delivers a secure global self-checking network. Unlike traditional Byzantine detection protocols which are receiver-based, this protocol gives the senders an active role in checking the node downstream. The key idea is inspired by Marti et al.'s watchdog-pathrater, which attempts to detect and mitigate the effects of routing misbehavior. We first focus on a two-hop network. We present a graphical model to understand the inference process nodes execute to police their downstream neighbors; as well as to compute, analyze, and approximate the probabilities of misdetection and false detection. We also present an algebraic analysis of the performance using an hypothesis testing framework that provides exact formulae for probabilities of false detection and misdetection. We then extend the algebraic watchdog to a more general network setting, and propose a protocol in which we can establish trust in coded systems in a distributed manner. We develop a graphical model to detect the presence of an adversarial node downstream within a general multi-hop network. The structure of the graphical model (a trellis) lends itself to well-known algorithms (e.g. the Viterbi algorithm) which can compute the probabilities of misdetection and false detection. We show that as long as the min-cut is not dominated by the adversaries, upstream nodes can monitor downstream neighbors and allow reliable communication with certain probability. Finally, we present simulation results that support our analysis.},

@article{Deb2006,
	abstract = {The problem of simultaneously disseminating k messages in a large network of n nodes, in a decentralized and distributed manner, where nodes only have knowledge about their own contents, is studied. In every discrete time-step, each node selects a communication partner randomly, uniformly among all nodes and only one message can be transmitted. The goal is to disseminate rapidly, with high probability, all messages to all nodes. It is shown that a random linear coding (RLC) based protocol disseminates all messages to all nodes in time ck+/spl Oscr/(/spl radic/kln(k)ln(n)), where c{\textless}3.46 using pull-based dissemination and c{\textless}5.96 using push-based dissemination. Simulations suggest that c{\textless}2 might be a tighter bound. Thus, if k/spl Gt/(ln(n))/sup 3/, the time for simultaneous dissemination RLC is asymptotically at most ck, versus the /spl Omega/(klog/sub 2/(n)) time of sequential dissemination. Furthermore, when k/spl Gt/(ln(n))/sup 3/, the dissemination time is order optimal. When k/spl Lt/(ln(n))/sup 2/, RLC reduces dissemination time by a factor of /spl Omega/(/spl radic/k/lnk) over sequential dissemination. The overhead of the RLC protocol is negligible for messages of reasonable size. A store-and-forward mechanism without coding is also considered. It is shown that this approach performs no better than a sequential approach when k=/spl prop/n. Owing to the distributed nature of the system, the proof requires analysis of an appropriate time-varying Bernoulli process.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel multipath multi-hop adaptive and causal random linear network coding (AC-RLNC) algorithm with forward error correction. This algorithm generalizes our joint optimization coding solution for point-to-point communication with delayed feedback. AC-RLNC is adaptive to the estimated channel condition, and is causal, as the coding adjusts the retransmission rates using a priori and posteriori algorithms. In the multipath network, to achieve the desired throughput and delay, we propose to incorporate an adaptive packet allocation algorithm for retransmission, across the available resources of the paths. This approach is based on a discrete water filling algorithm, i.e., bit-filling, but, with two desired objectives, maximize throughput and minimize the delay. In the multipath multi-hop setting, we propose a new decentralized balancing optimization algorithm. This balancing algorithm minimizes the throughput degradation, caused by the variations in the channel quality of the paths at each hop. Furthermore, to increase the efficiency, in terms of the desired objectives, we propose a new selective recoding method at the intermediate nodes. We derive bounds on the throughput and the mean and maximum in-order delivery delay of AC-RLNC, both in the multipath and multipath multi-hop case. In the multipath case, we prove that in the non-asymptotic regime, the suggested code may achieve more than 90\% of the channel capacity with zero error probability under mean and maximum in-order delay constraints, namely a mean delay smaller than three times the optimal genie-aided one and a maximum delay within eight times the optimum. In the multipath multi-hop case, the balancing procedure is proven to be optimal with regards to the achieved rate. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the performance of our adaptive and causal approach, compared to selective repeat (SR)-ARQ protocol, is capable of gains up to a factor two in throughput and a factor of more than three in mean delay and eight in maximum delay. The improvements on the throughput delay trade-off are also shown to be significant with regards to the previously developed singlepath AC-RLNC solution.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel adaptive and causal random linear network coding (AC-RLNC) algorithm with forward error correction (FEC) for a point-to-point communication channel with delayed feedback. AC-RLNC is adaptive to the channel condition, that the algorithm estimates, and is causal, as coding depends on the particular erasure realizations, as reflected in the feedback acknowledgments. Specifically, the proposed model can learn the erasure pattern of the channel via feedback acknowledgments, and adaptively adjust its retransmission rates using a priori and posteriori algorithms. By those adjustments, AC-RLNC achieves the desired delay and throughput, and enables transmission with zero error probability. We upper bound the throughput and the mean and maximum in order delivery delay of AC-RLNC, and prove that for the point to point communication channel in the non-asymptotic regime the proposed code may achieve more than 90\% of the channel capacity. To upper bound the throughput we utilize the minimum Bhattacharyya distance for the AC-RLNC code. We validate those results via simulations. We contrast the performance of AC-RLNC with the one of selective repeat (SR)-ARQ, which is causal but not adaptive, and is a posteriori. Via a study on experimentally obtained commercial traces, we demonstrate that a protocol based on AC-RLNC can, vis-{\`a}-vis SR-ARQ, double the throughput gains, and triple the gain in terms of mean in order delivery delay when the channel is bursty. Furthermore, the difference between the maximum and mean in order delivery delay is much smaller than that of SR-ARQ. Closing the delay gap along with boosting the throughput is very promising for enabling ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) applications.},

	abstract = {A family of equivalence tools for bounding network capacities is introduced. Given a network N with node set V, the capacity of N is a set of non-negative vectors with elements corresponding to all possible multicast connections in N; a vector ℜ is in the capacity region for N if and only if it is possible to simultaneously and reliably establish all multicast connections across N at the given rates. Any other demand type with independent messages is a special case of this multiple multicast problem, and is therefore included in the given rate region. In Part I, we show that the capacity of a network N is unchanged if any independent, memoryless, point-to-point channel in N is replaced by a noiseless bit pipe with throughput equal to the removed channel's capacity. It follows that the capacity of a network comprised entirely of such point-to-point channels equals the capacity of an error-free network that replaces each channel by a noiseless bit pipe of the corresponding capacity.

Our goal is to provide a reconstruction of sources within an allowed distortion level at each receiver. We perform joint source-channel coding at each source by randomly projecting source values to a lower dimensional space. We consider sources that satisfy the restricted eigenvalue (RE) condition as well as more general sources for which the randomness of the network allows a mapping to lower dimensional spaces. Our approach relies on using analog random linear network coding. The receiver uses compressive sensing decoders to reconstruct sources. Our key insight is the fact that, compressive sensing and analog network coding both preserve the source characteristics required for compressive sensing decoding.},

	abstract = {Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) provides a theoretically efficient method for coding. The drawbacks associated with it are the complexity of the decoding and the overhead resulting from the coding vector. This adds to the overall energy consumption and is problematic for computational limited and battery driven platforms. In this work we present an approach to RLNC where the code is sparse and non-uniform. The sparsity allow for fast encoding and decoding, and the non- uniform protection of symbols enables recoding where the produced symbols are indistinguishable from those encoded at the source. The results show that the approach presented here provides a better trade- off between coding throughput and code overhead. In particular it can provide a coding overhead identical to RLNC but at significantly reduced computational complexity. It also allow for easy adjustment of this trade-off, which make it suitable for a broad range of platforms and applications. Finally it is easy to perform recoding and coding vectors can be efficiently represented.},

@article{Kose2021,
	abstract = {In this article, we address the scheduling problem in wireless ad hoc networks by exploiting the computational advantage that comes when scheduling problems can be represented by claw-free conflict graphs where we consider a wireless broadcast medium. It is possible to formulate a scheduling problem of broadcast transmissions as finding the maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) in the conflict graph of the network. Finding the MWIS of a general graph is NP-hard leading to an NP-hard complexity of scheduling. In a claw-free conflict graph, MWIS may be found in polynomial time leading to a throughput-optimal scheduling. We show that the conflict graphs of certain wireless ad hoc networks are claw-free. In order to obtain claw-free conflict graphs in general networks, we suggest introducing additional conflicts (edges) with the aim of keeping the decrease in MWIS size minimal. To this end, we introduce an iterative optimization problem to decide where to introduce edges and investigate its efficient implementation. We conclude that the claw breaking method by adding extra edges can perform very close to optimal scenario and better than the polynomial time maximal independent set scheduling benchmark under the necessary assumptions.},

	abstract = {We propose a new feedback-based adaptive coding scheme for a packet erasure broadcast channel. The main performance metric of interest is the delay. We consider two types of delay - decoding delay and delivery delay. Decoding delay is the time difference between the instant when the packet is decoded at an arbitrary receiver and the instant when it arrived at the sender. Delivery delay also includes the period when a decoded packet waits in a resequencing buffer at the receiver until all previous packets have also been decoded. This notion of delay is motivated by applications that accept packets only in order. Our coding scheme has the innovation guarantee property and is hence throughput optimal. It also allows efficient queue management. It uses the simple strategy of mixing only the oldest undecoded packet of each receiver, and therefore extends to any number of receivers. We conjecture that this scheme achieves the asymptotically optimal delivery (and hence decoding) delay. The asymptotic behavior is studied in the limit as the load factor of the system approaches capacity. This conjecture is verified through simulations.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the communication and storage costs of emulating atomic (linearizable) multi-writer multi-reader shared memory in distributed message-passing systems. The paper contains three main contributions: (1) we present an atomic shared-memory emulation algorithm that we call Coded Atomic Storage (CAS). This algorithm uses erasure coding methods. In a storage system with N servers that is resilient to f server failures, we show that the communication cost of CAS is \$\${\textbackslash}frac\{N\}\{N-2f\}\$\$. The storage cost of CAS is unbounded. (2) We present a modification of the CAS algorithm known as CAS with garbage collection (CASGC). The CASGC algorithm is parameterized by an integer \$\${\textbackslash}delta \$\$and has a bounded storage cost. We show that the CASGC algorithm satisfies atomicity. In every execution of CASGC where the number of server failures is no bigger than f, we show that every write operation invoked at a non-failing client terminates. We also show that in an execution of CASGC with parameter \$\${\textbackslash}delta \$\$where the number of server failures is no bigger than f,  a read operation terminates provided that the number of write operations that are concurrent with the read is no bigger than \$\${\textbackslash}delta \$\$. We explicitly characterize the storage cost of CASGC, and show that it has the same communication cost as CAS. (3) We describe an algorithm known as the Communication Cost Optimal Atomic Storage (CCOAS) algorithm that achieves a smaller communication cost than CAS and CASGC. In particular, CCOAS incurs read and write communication costs of \$\${\textbackslash}frac\{N\}\{N-f\}\$\$measured in terms of number of object values. We also discuss drawbacks of CCOAS as compared with CAS and CASGC.},

An analysis of the delay's first two moments is provided so that we can determine when and how much redundancy should be added to meet a user's requirements. Numerical results help show the gains over selective repeat ARQ, as well as the trade-offs between meeting the user's delay constraints and the costs inflicted on the achievable rate.

@article{Beirami2019,
	abstract = {Given a collection of strings, each with an associated probability of occurrence, the guesswork of each of them is their position in a list ordered from most likely to least likely, breaking ties arbitrarily. The guesswork is central to several applications in information theory: average guesswork provides a lower bound on the expected computational cost of a sequential decoder to decode successfully the transmitted message; the complementary cumulative distribution function of guesswork gives the error probability in list decoding; the logarithm of guesswork is the number of bits needed in optimal lossless one-to-one source coding; and the guesswork is the number of trials required of an adversary to breach a password protected system in a brute-force attack. In this paper, we consider memoryless string sources that generate strings consisting of independent and identically distributed characters drawn from a finite alphabet, and characterize their corresponding guesswork. Our main tool is the tilt operation on a memoryless string source. We show that the tilt operation on a memoryless string source parametrizes an exponential family of memoryless string sources, which we refer to as the tilted family of the string source. We provide an operational meaning to the tilted families by proving that two memoryless string sources result in the same guesswork on all strings of all lengths if and only if their respective categorical distributions belong to the same tilted family. Establishing some general properties of the tilt operation, we generalize the notions of weakly typical set and asymptotic equipartition property to tilted weakly typical sets of different orders. We use this new definition to characterize the large deviations for all atypical strings and characterize the volume of tilted weakly typical sets of different orders. We subsequently build on this characterization to prove large deviation bounds on guesswork and provide an accurate approximation of its probability mass function.},

	abstract = {We investigate a deterministic binary coding approach for combination networks. In the literature, network coding schemes with large alphabet sizes achieve the min-cut capacity. Here, we propose an approach using binary (GF(2)) sequences instead of going to a large alphabet size. In the encoding process, only cyclic-shifting and XOR operations are used. The encoding complexity is linear with the length of information bits. The transfer matrix is sparse, and the decoder can perfectly decode source information by a sparse- matrix processing approach. Our approach does not use any redundant bits, and achieves the min-cut capacity. Further, the code blocks can be produced in a rateless way. The sink can decode source information from any subset of code blocks, if the number of received distinct blocks is the same as that of the information blocks. Thus, we use the code for general networks with erasure channels. The proposed binary rateless codes have quite small overheads and can work with a small number of blocks. With high probability, the codes behave as maximum distance separable (MDS) codes.},

We present AmbientTalk, a distributed programming language designed specifically to develop mobile peer-to-peer applications. AmbientTalk aims to make it easy to develop mobile applications that are resilient to network failures by design. We describe the language's concurrency and distribution model in detail, as it lies at the heart of AmbientTalk's support for responsive, resilient application development. The model is based on communicating event loops, itself a descendant of the actor model. We contribute a small-step operational semantics for this model and use it to establish data race and deadlock freedom.},

	abstract = {For concurrent programming to become mainstream, we must discard threads as a programming model. Nondeterminism should be judiciously and carefully introduced where needed, and it should be explicit in programs. In general-purpose software engineering practice, we have reached a point where one approach to concurrent programming dominates all others namely, threads, sequential processes that share memory. They represent a key concurrency model supported by modern computers, programming languages, and operating systems. In scientific computing, where performance requirements have long demanded concurrent programming, data-parallel language extensions and message-passing libraries such as PVM, MPI, and OpenMP dominate over threads for concurrent programming. Computer architectures intended for scientific computing often differ significantly from so-called general-purpose architectures.},

The standard interpretation for such configurations induces a fixed-point constraint on the function modeling the component involved. We define strictly causal functions formally, and show that the corresponding fixed-point problem does not always have a well defined solution. We examine the relationship between these functions and the functions that are strictly contracting with respect to a generalized distance function on signals, and argue that these strictly contracting functions are actually the functions that one ought to be interested in. We prove a constructive fixed-point theorem for these functions, introduce a corresponding induction principle, and study the related convergence process.},

@article{Liu2008,
	abstract = {We give a denotational framework for composing interactive components into closed or open systems and show how to adapt classical domain-theoretic approaches to open systems and to timed systems. For timed systems, prior approaches are based on temporal logics, automata theory, or metric spaces. In this paper, we base the semantics on a CPO with a prefix order, as has been done previously for untimed systems. We show that existence and uniqueness of behaviors are ensured by continuity with respect to this prefix order. Existence and uniqueness of behaviors, however, do not imply that a composition of components yields a useful behavior. The unique behavior could be empty or smaller than expected. We define liveness and show that appropriately defined causality conditions ensure liveness and freedom from Zeno conditions. In our formulation, causality does not require a metric and can embrace a wide variety of models of time.},

@article{Zhou2008,
	abstract = {We consider concurrent models of computation where ``actors'' (components that are in charge of their own actions) communicate by exchanging messages. The interfaces of actors principally consist of ``ports,'' which mediate the exchange of messages. Actor-oriented architectures contrast with and complement object-oriented models by emphasizing the exchange of data between concurrent components rather than transformation of state. Examples of such models of computation include the classical actor model, synchronous languages, data-flow models, process networks, and discrete-event models. Many experimental and production languages used to design embedded systems are actor oriented and based on one of these models of computation. Many of these models of computation benefit considerably from having access to causality information about the components. This paper augments the interfaces of such components to include such causality information. It shows how this causality information can be algebraically composed so that compositions of components acquire causality interfaces that are inferred from their components and the interconnections. We illustrate the use of these causality interfaces to statically analyze timed models and synchronous language compositions for causality loops and data-flow models for deadlock. We also show that that causality analysis for each communication cycle can be performed independently and in parallel, and it is only necessary to analyze one port for each cycle. Finally, we give a conservative approximation technique for handling dynamically changing causality properties.},

Because it relies on a graph representation of programs, the strengths of the dataflow model are very much the complements of those of the stored-program one. In the last thirty or so years since it was proposed, the dataflow model of computation has been used and developed in very many areas of computing research: from programming languages to processor design, and from signal processing to reconfigurable computing. This paper is a review of the current state-of-the-art in the applications of the dataflow model of computation. It focuses on three areas: multithreaded computing, signal processing and reconfigurable computing.},

That prior work provides specific designs for PRET microarchitectures and compares them against conventional designs. This paper defines a class of microarchitectures called abstract PRET machines (APMs) that capture the essential temporal properties of PRET machines. We show that APMs deliver deterministic timing with no loss of performance for a family of real-time problems consisting of sporadic event streams with deadlines equal to periods. On the other hand, we observe a tradeoff between deterministic timing and the ability to meet deadlines for sporadic event streams with constrained deadlines.},

	abstract = {We present HotStuff, a leader-based Byzantine fault-tolerant replication protocol for the partially synchronous model. Once network communication becomes synchronous, HotStuff enables a correct leader to drive the protocol to consensus at the pace of actual (vs. maximum) network delay--a property called responsiveness--and with communication complexity that is linear in the number of replicas. To our knowledge, HotStuff is the first partially synchronous BFT replication protocol exhibiting these combined properties. HotStuff is built around a novel framework that forms a bridge between classical BFT foundations and blockchains. It allows the expression of other known protocols (DLS, PBFT, Tendermint, Casper), and ours, in a common framework. Our deployment of HotStuff over a network with over 100 replicas achieves throughput and latency comparable to that of BFT-SMaRt, while enjoying linear communication footprint during leader failover (vs. quadratic with BFT-SMaRt).},

	abstract = {Quantum computers will revolutionize the way telecommunications networks function. Quantum computing holds the promise of solving problems that would be intractable with conventional computers by implementing principles from quantum physics in the development of computer hardware, software and communications equipment. Quantum-assisted computing will be the first step towards full quantum systems, and will cause immense disruption of our traditional networks. The world's biggest manufacturers are investing large amounts of resources to develop crucial quantum-assisted circuits and devices. Quantum Computing and Communications:  Gives an overview of basic quantum computing algorithms and their enhanced versions such as efficient database searching, counting and phase estimation. Introduces quantum-assisted solutions for telecom problems including multi-user detection in mobile systems, routing in IP based networks, and secure ciphering key distribution. Includes an accompanying website featuring exercises (with solution manual) and sample algorithms from the classical telecom world, corresponding quantum-based solutions, bridging the gap between pure theory and engineering practice.  This book provides telecommunications engineers, as well as graduate students and researchers in the fields of computer science and telecommunications, with a wide overview of quantum computing \& communications and a wealth of essential, practical information.},

	abstract = {The standard operational probabilistic framework (within which we can formulate Operational Quantum Theory) is time asymmetric. This is clear because the conditions on allowed operations are time asymmetric. It is odd, though, because Schoedinger's equation is time symmetric and probability theory does not care about time direction. In this work we provide a time symmetric framework for operational theories in general and for Quantum Theory in particular. The clearest expression of the time asymmetry of standard Operational Quantum Theory is that the deterministic effect is unique - meaning there is only one way to ignore the future - while deterministic (i.e normalised) states are not unique. In this paper, this time asymmetry is traced back to a time asymmetric understanding of the most basic elements of an operational theory - namely the operations (or boxes) out of which circuits are built. We modify this allowing operations to have classical incomes as well as classical outcomes on these operations. We establish a time symmetric operational framework for circuits built out of operations. In particular, we demand that the probability associated with a circuit is the same whether we calculate it forwards in time or backwards in time. We do this by imposing various double properties. These are properties wherein a forward in time and a backward in time version of the same property are required. In this paper we provide a new causality condition which we call double causality.},

	abstract = {The methods of the quantum theory of computation are used to analyze the physics of closed timelike lines. This is dominated, even at the macroscopic level, by quantum mechanics. In classical physics the existence of such lines in a spacetime imposes  paradoxical  constraints on the state of matter in their past and also provides means for knowledge to be created in ways that conflict with the principles of the philosophy of science. In quantum mechanics the first of these pathologies does not occur. The second is mitigated, and may be avoidable without such spacetimes being ruled out. Several novel and distinctive (but nonparadoxical) quantum-mechanical effects occur on and near closed timelike lines, including violations of the correspondence principle and of unitarity. It becomes possible to  clone  quantum systems and to measure the state of a quantum system. A new experimental test of the Everett interpretation against all others becomes possible. Consideration of these and other effects sheds light on the nature of quantum mechanics.},

	abstract = {Evolution is full of coevolving systems characterized by complex spatio-temporal interactions that lead to intertwined processes of adaptation. Yet, how adaptation across multiple levels of temporal scales and biological complexity is achieved remains unclear. Here, we formalize how evolutionary multi-scale processing underlying adaptation constitutes a form of metacognition flowing from definitions of metaprocessing in machine learning. We show (1) how the evolution of metacognitive systems can be expected when fitness landscapes vary on multiple time scales, and (2) how multiple time scales emerge during coevolutionary processes of sufficiently complex interactions. After defining a metaprocessor as a regulator with local memory, we prove that metacognition is more energetically efficient than purely object-level cognition when selection operates at multiple timescales in evolution. Furthermore, we show that existing modeling approaches to coadaptation and coevolution-here active inference networks, predator-prey interactions, coupled genetic algorithms, and generative adversarial networks-lead to multiple emergent timescales underlying forms of metacognition. Lastly, we show how coarse-grained structures emerge naturally in any resource-limited system, providing sufficient evidence for metacognitive systems to be a prevalent and vital component of (co-)evolution. Therefore, multi-scale processing is a necessary requirement for many evolutionary scenarios, leading to de facto metacognitive evolutionary outcomes.},

In the last few years, there has been substantial progress in understanding the correlations present in quantum networks. In this article, we study cloning as a prospective method to generate three party quantum networks which can be further used to create larger networks. We analyze various quantum network topologies that can be created using cloning transformations. This would be useful in the situations wherever the availability of entangled pairs is limited. In addition to that we focus on the problem of distinguishing networks created by cloning from those which are created by distributing independently generated entangled pairs. We find that there are several states which cannot be distinguished using the Finner inequalities in the standard way. For such states, we propose an extension to the existing Finner inequality for triangle networks by further increasing the number of observers from three to four or six depending on the network topology. This takes into account the additional correlations that exist in the case of cloned networks. In the last part of the article we have used tripartite mutual information to distinguish cloned networks from networks created by independent sources and have further used squashed entanglement as a measure to quantify the amount of dependence in the cloned networks.},

@article{Fields2018,
	abstract = {A fundamental aspect of life is the modification of anatomy, physiology, and behavior in the face of changing conditions. This is especially illustrated by the adaptive regulation of growth and form that underlies the ability of most organisms---from single cells to complex large metazoa---to develop, remodel, and regenerate to specific anatomical patterns. What is the relationship of the genome and other cellular components to the robust computations that underlie this remarkable pattern homeostasis? Here we examine the role of constraints defined at the cellular level, especially endogenous bioelectricity, in generating and propagating biological information. We review evidence that the genome is only one of several multi-generational biological memories. Focusing on the cell membrane and cytoplasm, which is physically continuous across all of life in evolutionary timeframes, we characterize the environment as an interstitial space through which messages are passed via bioelectric and biochemical codes. We argue that biological memory is a fundamental phenomenon that cannot be understood at any one scale, and suggest that functional studies of information propagated in non-genomic cellular structures will not only strongly impact evolutionary developmental biology, but will also have implications for regenerative medicine and synthetic bioengineering.

The equivalence problems in CCS are presented as refinements of the familiar problem of testing whether two nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) are equivalent, i.e., accept the same language. Three notions of equivalence proposed for CCS are investigated, namely, observational equivalence, strong observational equivalence, and failure equivalence. We show that observational equivalence can be tested in polynomial time. As defined in CCS, observational equivalence is the limit of a sequence of successively finer equivalence relations, ≈k, where ≈1 is nondeterministic finite automaton equivalence. We prove that, for each fixed k, deciding ≈k is PSPACE-complete. We show that strong observational equivalence can be decided in polynomial time by reducing it to generalized partitioning, a new combinatorial problem of independent interest. Finally, we demonstrate that testing for failure equivalence is PSPACE-complete, even for a very restricted type of process.},

@inproceedings{Michael2002,
	abstract = {A major obstacle to the wide use of lock-free data structures, despite their many performance and reliability advantages, is the absence of a practical lock-free method for reclaiming the memory of dynamic nodes removed from dynamic lock-free objects for arbitrary reuse.The only prior lock-free memory reclamation method depends on the DCAS atomic primitive, which is not supported on any current processor architecture. Other memory management methods are blocking, require special operating system support, or do not allow arbitrary memory reuse.This paper presents the first lock-free memory management method for dynamic lock-free objects that allows arbitrary memory reuse, and does not require special operating system or hardware support. It guarantees an upper bound on the number of removed nodes not yet freed at any time, regardless of thread failures and delays. Furthermore, it is wait-free, it is only logarithmically contention-sensitive, and it uses only atomic reads and writes for its operations. In addition, it can be used to prevent the ABA problem for pointers to dynamic nodes in most algorithms, without requiring extra space per pointer or per node.},

@article{Rajwar2002,
	abstract = {This paper is motivated by the difficulty in writing correct high-performance programs. Writing shared-memory multi-threaded programs imposes a complex trade-off between programming ease and performance, largely due to subtleties in coordinating access to shared data. To ensure correctness programmers often rely on conservative locking at the expense of performance. The resulting serialization of threads is a performance bottleneck. Locks also interact poorly with thread scheduling and faults, resulting in poor system performance.We seek to improve multithreaded programming trade-offs by providing architectural support for optimistic lock-free execution. In a lock-free execution, shared objects are never locked when accessed by various threads. We propose Transactional Lock Removal (TLR) and show how a program that uses lock-based synchronization can be executed by the hardware in a lock-free manner, even in the presence of conflicts, without programmer support or software changes. TLR uses timestamps for conflict resolution, modest hardware, and features already present in many modern computer systems.TLR's benefits include improved programmability, stability, and performance. Programmers can obtain benefits of lock-free data structures, such as non-blocking behavior and wait-freedom, while using lock-protected critical sections for writing programs.},

Robb's philosophy of time stemming from his interpretation of relativity theory; and at the same time, to investigate the reasons for the failure of his philosophical contemporaries to appreciate its significance, with special attention to its reception on Russell's part. The study of Russell's reaction to Robb exposes shortcomings in Russell's own philosophy of time, which has been extremely influential through the years. It also highlights the philosophical differences between Minkowski and Robb, the shared idealistic premises of Russell and McTaggart, and the confluences between the views of Russell, Eddington and McTaggart. The paper closes with an account of how Robb's interpretation has been vindicated by its adoption in modern physics.},

@misc{Catani2022,
	abstract = {Quantum interference phenomena are widely viewed as posing a challenge to the classical worldview. Feynman even went so far as to proclaim that they are the only mystery and the basic peculiarity of quantum mechanics. Many have also argued that such phenomena force us to accept a number of radical interpretational conclusions, including: that a photon is neither a particle nor a wave but rather a Jekyll-and-Hyde sort of entity that toggles between the two possibilities, that reality is observer-dependent, and that systems either do not have properties prior to measurements or else have properties that are subject to nonlocal or backwards-in-time causal influences. In this work, we show that such conclusions are not, in fact, forced on us by the phenomena. We do so by describing an alternative to quantum theory, a statistical theory of a classical discrete field (the `toy field theory') that reproduces the relevant phenomenology of quantum interference while rejecting these radical interpretational claims. It also reproduces a number of related interference experiments that are thought to support these interpretational claims, such as the Elitzur-Vaidman bomb tester, Wheeler's delayed-choice experiment, and the quantum eraser experiment. The systems in the toy field theory are field modes, each of which possesses, at all times, both a particle-like property (a discrete occupation number) and a wave-like property (a discrete phase). Although these two properties are jointly possessed, the theory stipulates that they cannot be jointly known. The phenomenology that is generally cited in favour of nonlocal or backwards-in-time causal influences ends up being explained in terms of inferences about distant or past systems, and all that is observer-dependent is the observer's knowledge of reality, not reality itself.},

	abstract = {In recent years we have been exploring a novel asynchronous, ballistic physical model of reversible computing, variously termed ABRC (Asynchronous Ballistic Reversible Computing) or BARC (Ballistic Asynchronous Reversible Computing). In this model, localized information-bearing pulses propagate bidirectionally along nonbranching interconnects between I/O ports of stateful circuit elements, which carry out reversible transformations of the local digital state. The model appears suitable for implementation in superconducting circuits, using the naturally quantized configuration of magnetic flux in the circuit to encode digital information. One of the early research thrusts in this effort involves the enumeration and classification, at an abstract theoretical level, of the distinct possible reversible digital functional behaviors that primitive BARC circuit elements may exhibit, given the applicable conservation and symmetry constraints in superconducting implementations. In this paper, we describe the motivations for this work, outline our research methodology, and summarize some of the noteworthy preliminary results to date from our theoretical study of BARC elements for bipolarized pulses, and having up to three I/O ports and two internal digital states.},

Moreover, I argue that the locality assumption for product states is weaker than the preparation independence assumption of the PBR theorem.

Our investigation proceeds from two complementary fronts: a topological one, using tools from sheaf theory, and a geometric one, based on polytopes and linear programming. From the topological perspective, we understand experimental outcome probabilities as bundles of compatible contextual data over certain topological spaces, encoding causality constraints. From the geometric perspective, we understand the same experimental outcome probabilities as points in high-dimensional causal polytopes, which we explicitly construct and fully characterise. Our work is a significant extension of both the established Abramsky-Brandenburger framework for contextuality and the current body of work on indefinite causality. We provide definitions of causal fraction and causal separability for empirical models relative to a broad class of causal constraints: this allows us to construct and characterise novel examples which explicitly connect causal inseparability to non-locality and contextuality. In particular, we clearly demonstrate the existence of ``causal contextuality'', a phenomenon where causal structure is explicitly correlated to the classical inputs and outputs of local instruments, so that contextuality of the associated empirical model directly implies causal inseparability.},

	abstract = {Information is physical, and for a physical theory to be universal, it should model observers as physical systems, with concrete memories where they store the information acquired through experiments and reasoning. Here we address these issues in Spekkens' toy theory, a non-contextual epistemically restricted model that partially mimics the behaviour of quantum mechanics. We propose a way to model physical implementations of agents, memories, measurements, conditional actions and information processing. We find that the actions of toy agents are severely limited: although there are non-orthogonal states in the theory, there is no way for physical agents to consciously prepare them. Their memories are also constrained: agents cannot forget in which of two arbitrary states a system is. Finally, we formalize the process of making inferences about other agents' experiments and model multi-agent experiments like Wigner's friend. Unlike quantum theory or box world, in the toy theory there are no inconsistencies when physical agents reason about each other's knowledge.},

@article{Imas,
	abstract = {We propose that a person's desire to consume an object or possess an attribute increases in how much others want but cannot have it. We term this motive superiority-seeking, and show that it generates preferences for exclusion that help explain a host of market anomalies and make novel predictions in a variety of domains. In bilateral exchange, there is a reluctance to trade and people exhibit a `social endowment effect.' People's value of consuming a good increases in its scarcity, which generates a motive for firms and organizations to cater to such preferences by engaging in exclusionary policies. Randomly barring potential consumers from the opportunity to acquire a product increases the seller's profits both in standard monopoly and auction settings. Such non-price-based exclusion leads to higher revenues than the classic optimal sales mechanisms. A series of experiments provides direct support for these predictions. In basic exchange, a person's willingness to pay for a good increases as more people are explicitly barred from the opportunity to acquire it. In auctions, randomly excluding people from the opportunity to bid substantially increases bids amongst those who retain this option. Exclusion leads to bigger gains in expected revenue than increasing competition through inclusion. Our model of superiority-seeking generates `Veblen effects,' rationalizes attitudes against redistribution, and provides a novel motive for social stratification and discrimination.},

@inproceedings{Kassam2022,
	abstract = {TCP is typically the default transport protocol of choice for its supposed reliability, even for message-oriented middleware (e.g., ZeroMQ) or inter-actor communication (e.g., distributed Erlang). However, under network issues, TCP connections can fail, which requires ensuring both at-leastonce and at-most-once delivery at the upper middleware layer. Moreover, the use of TCP at scale, in highly concurrent systems, can lead to drastic performance loss due to the need for TCP connection multiplexing and the resulting head-of-line blocking. This paper introduces Exon, an oblivious exactlyonce messaging protocol, and a corresponding lightweight library implementation. Exon uses a novel strategy of a per-message four-way protocol to ensure oblivious exactlyonce messaging, with on-demand protocol-level ``soft halfconnections'' that are established when needed and safely discarded. This achieves correctness, obliviousness, and performance, through merging and pipelining basic protocol messages. The empirical evaluation of Exon demonstrates significant improvements in throughput and latency under packet loss, while maintaining a negligible overhead over TCP in healthy networks.},

@article{Li,
	abstract = {Clock synchronization is critical for many datacenter applications such as distributed transactional databases, consistent snapshots, and network telemetry. As applications have increasing performance requirements and datacenter networks get into ultra-low latency, we need submicrosecond-level bound on time-uncertainty to reduce transaction delay and enable new network management applications (e.g., measuring one-way delay for congestion control). The state-of-the-art clock synchronization solutions focus on improving clock precision but may incur significant time-uncertainty bound due to the presence of failures. This significantly affects applications because in large-scale datacenters, temperature-related, link, device, and domain failures are common. We present Sundial, a fault-tolerant clock synchronization system for datacenters that achieves ∼100ns time-uncertainty bound under various types of failures. Sundial provides fast failure detection based on frequent synchronization messages in hardware. Sundial enables fast failure recovery using a novel graphbased algorithm to precompute a backup plan that is generic to failures. Through experiments in a {\textgreater}500-machine testbed and large-scale simulations, we show that Sundial can achieve ∼100ns time-uncertainty bound under different types of failures, which is more than two orders of magnitude lower than the state-of-the-art solutions. We also demonstrate the benefit of Sundial on applications such as Spanner and Swift congestion control.},

In the static case it shows no presence of the horizon while it has a wormhole structure mimicking the black hole. In the dynamical case, perturbed by a pulse of classical matter, there appears an apparent horion while the spacetime remains to be a regular causal diamond. We compute the asymptotic radiation both in the static and dynamic case. We define entropy of the asymptotic radiation and demonstrate that as a function of the retarded time it shows the behavior typical for the Page curve. We suggest interpretation of our findings in terms of correlations in the virtual pairs of physical and non-physical particles spontaneously created in the spacetime.},

We propose techniques to prevent and recover from these problems by reducing the separation between local file systems and synchronization clients, providing clients with deeper knowledge of file system activity and allowing the file system to take advantage of the correct data stored remotely.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            We extend stochastic thermodynamics by relaxing the two assumptions that the Markovian dynamics must be linear and that the equilibrium distribution must be a Boltzmann distribution. We show that if we require the second law to hold when those assumptions are relaxed, then it cannot be formulated in terms of Shannon entropy. However, thermodynamic consistency is salvaged if we reformulate the second law in terms of generalized entropy; our first result is an equation relating the precise form of the non-linear master equation to the precise associated generalized entropy which results in thermodynamic consistency. We then build on this result to extend the usual trajectory-level definitions of thermodynamic quantities that are appropriate even when the two assumptions are relaxed. We end by using these trajectory-level definitions to derive extended versions of the Crooks fluctuation theorem and Jarzynski equality which apply when the two assumptions are relaxed.},

	abstract = {Many systems today distribute trust across multiple parties such that the system provides certain security properties if a subset of the parties are honest. In the past few years, we have seen an explosion of academic and industrial cryptographic systems built on distributed trust, including secure multi-party computation applications (e.g., private analytics, secure learning, and private key recovery) and blockchains. These systems have great potential for improving security and privacy, but face a significant hurdle on the path to deployment. We initiate study of the following problem: a single organization is, by definition, a single party, and so how can a single organization build a distributed-trust system where corruptions are independent? We instead consider an alternative formulation of the problem: rather than ensuring that a distributed-trust system is set up correctly by design, what if instead, users can audit a distributed-trust deployment? We propose a framework that enables a developer to efficiently and cheaply set up any distributed-trust system in a publicly auditable way. To do this, we identify two application-independent building blocks that we can use to bootstrap arbitrary distributed-trust applications: secure hardware and an append-only log. We show how to leverage existing implementations of these building blocks to deploy distributed-trust systems, and we give recommendations for infrastructure changes that would make it easier to deploy distributed-trust systems in the future.},

	abstract = {The fundamental nature of Dark Matter remains one of the major mysteries of modern physics. Some models postulate the existence of a massive gauge boson, a  dark photon  (\$A{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}prime\$), that may allow Dark Matter particles to interact with Standard Model particles. Ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions produce highly Lorentz-contracted electromagnetic fields with sufficient energy density to potentially manifest as light dark photons. We report limits on dark photon parameters via a search for anomalous production of \$e{\textasciicircum}+e{\textasciicircum}-\$ pairs in \${\textbackslash}gamma A{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}prime\$ and \$A{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}prime A{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}prime\$ fusion from ultra-peripheral \${\textbackslash}rm\{Au\}+{\textbackslash}rm\{Au\}\$ collisions. This study utilizes measurements of the Breit-Wheeler process (\${\textbackslash}gamma{\textbackslash}gamma {\textbackslash}rightarrow e{\textasciicircum}+e{\textasciicircum}-\$) carried out by STAR, specifically making use of polarization-dependent final-state azimuthal asymmetries in \$e{\textasciicircum}+e{\textasciicircum}-\$ pairs. These limits are informative for future searches in the ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions and to constrain future theoretical developments of the dark photon mechanism.},

	abstract = {Most existing concepts for hardware implementation of reversible computing invoke an adiabatic computing paradigm, in which individual degrees of freedom (e.g., node voltages) are synchronously transformed under the influence of externally- supplied driving signals. But distributing these  power/clock  signals to all gates within a design while efficiently recovering their energy is difficult. Can we reduce clocking overhead using a ballistic approach, wherein data signals self- propagating between devices drive most state transitions? Traditional concepts of ballistic computing, such as the classic Billiard-Ball Model, typically rely on a precise synchronization of interacting signals, which can fail due to exponential amplification of timing differences when signals interact. In this paper, we develop a general model of Asynchronous Ballistic Reversible Computing (ABRC) that aims to address these problems by eliminating the requirement for precise synchronization between signals. Asynchronous reversible devices in this model are isomorphic to a restricted set of Mealy finite- state machines. We explore ABRC devices having up to 3 bidirectional I/O terminals and up to 2 internal states, identifying a simple pair of such devices that comprises a computationally universal set of primitives. We also briefly discuss how ABRC might be implemented using single flux quanta in superconducting circuits.},

This essentially resolves the classic negative-weight SSSP problem. The previous bounds are $\tilde O((m+n^{1.5})\log W)$ [BLNPSSSW FOCS'20] and $m^{4/3+o(1)}\log W$ [AMV FOCS'20]. Near-linear time algorithms were known previously only for the special case of planar directed graphs [Fakcharoenphol and Rao FOCS'01]. 
In contrast to all recent developments that rely on sophisticated continuous optimization methods and dynamic algorithms, our algorithm is simple: it requires only a simple graph decomposition and elementary combinatorial tools. In fact, ours is the first combinatorial algorithm for negative-weight SSSP to break through the classic $\tilde O(m\sqrt{n}\log W)$ bound from over three decades ago [Gabow and Tarjan SICOMP'89].},

	abstract = {In 1986 Jim Gray published his landmark study of the causes of failures of Tandem systems and the techniques Tandem used to prevent such failures [6]. Seventeen years later, Internet services have replaced fault-tolerant servers as the new kid on the 24x7-availability block. Using data from three large-scale Internet services, we analyzed the causes of their failures and the (potential) effectiveness of various techniques for preventing and mitigating service failure. We find that (1) operator error is the largest cause of failures in two of the three services, (2) operator error is the largest contributor to time to repair in two of the three services, (3) configuration errors are the largest category of operator errors, (4) failures in custom-written front-end software are significant, and (5) more extensive online testing and more thoroughly exposing and detecting component failures would reduce failure rates in at least one service. Qualitatively we find that improvement in the maintenance tools and systems used by service operations staff would decrease time to diagnose and repair problems.},

Through our analysis, we seek to answer several fundamental questions: which devices/links are most unreliable, what causes failures, how do failures impact network traffic and how effective is network redundancy? We answer these questions using multiple data sources commonly collected by network operators. The key findings of our study are that (1) data center networks show high reliability, (2) commodity switches such as ToRs and AggS are highly reliable, (3) load balancers dominate in terms of failure occurrences with many short-lived software related faults, (4) failures have potential to cause loss of many small packets such as keep alive messages and ACKs, and (5) network redundancy is only 40\% effective in reducing the median impact of failure.},

It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and it is as efficient as Paxos, but its structure is different from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than Paxos and also provides a better foundation for building practical systems. In order to enhance understandability, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered. Results from a user study demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than Paxos. Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing the cluster membership, which uses overlapping majorities to guarantee safety.},

@misc{Osborn2022,
	abstract = {Reversible logic can provide lower switching energy costs relative to all irreversible logic, including those developed by industry in semiconductor circuits, however, more research is needed to understand what is possible. Superconducting logic, an exemplary platform for both irreversible and reversible logic, uses flux quanta to represent bits, and the reversible implementation may switch state with low energy dissipation relative to the energy of a flux quantum. Here we simulate reversible shift register gates that are ballistic -- their operation is powered by the input bits alone. A storage loop is added relative to previous gates as a key innovation, which bestows an asynchronous property such that input bits can arrive at different times as long as their order is clearly preserved. The shift register represents bit states by flux polarity, both in the stored bit as well as the ballistic input and output bits. Its operation consists of the elastic swapping of flux between the stored and the moving bit. This is related to a famous irreversible shift register, developed prior to the advent of superconducting flux quanta logic (which used irreversible gates). In the base design of our ballistic shift register (BSR) there is one 1-input and 1-output port, but we find that we can make other asynchronous ballistic gates by extension. For example, we show that two BSRs operate in sequence without power added, giving a 2-bit sequential memory. We also show that a BSR with two input and two output ports allows a bit state to be set from one input port and then conveyed out on either output port. The gate constitutes the first asynchronous reversible 2-input gate. Finally, for a better insight into the dynamics, we introduce a collective coordinate model, where motion reduces to two coordinates and is subject to a potential determined by the input bit and initial stored flux quantum.},

	abstract = {In order to better understand a complex theory like quantum mechanics, it is sometimes useful to take a step back and create alternative theories, with more intuitive foundations, and examine which features of quantum mechanics can be reproduced by such a foil theory. A prominent example is Spekkens' toy theory, which is based off a simple premise:  What if we took a common classical theory and added the uncertainty principle as a postulate?  In other words, the theory imposes an epistemic restriction on our knowledge about a physical system: only half of the variables can ever be known to an observer. Like good science fiction, from this simple principle a rich behaviour emerges, most notoriously when we compose several systems. The toy theory emulates some aspects of quantum non-locality, although crucially it is still a non-contextual model. In this pedagogical review we consolidate different approaches to Spekkens' toy theory, including the stabilizer formalism and the generalization to arbitrary dimensions, completing them with new results where necessary. In particular, we introduce a general characterization of measurements, superpositions and entanglement in the toy theory.},

	abstract = {The recently developed framework for quantum theory with no global causal order allows for quantum processes in which operations in local laboratories are neither causally ordered nor in a probabilistic mixture of definite causal orders. The causal relation between the laboratories is described by the process matrix. We show that, if the inputs of the laboratories are measured in a fixed basis, one can introduce an effective process matrix which is operationally indistinguishable from the original one. This effective process matrix can be obtained by applying the von Neumann- Lu{\textbackslash} ders update rule for nonselective measurements to the original process matrix and in the bipartite case it is compatible with a definite causal order. The latter extends the original Oreshkov et al. proof where one considers that both the measurement of the input and the re-preparation of the output are performed in a fixed basis.},

	abstract = {Applying ideas from monadic dynamics to the well-established framework of categorical quantum mechanics, we provide a novel toolbox for the simulation of finite-dimensional quantum dynamics. We use strongly complementary structures to give a graphical characterisation of quantum clocks, their action on systems and the relevant energy observables, and we proceed to formalise the connection between unitary dynamics and projection-valued spectra. We identify the Weyl canonical commutation relations in the axioms of strong complementarity, and conclude the existence of a dual pair of time/energy observables for finite-dimensional quantum clocks, with the relevant uncertainty principle given by mutual unbias of the corresponding orthonormal bases. We show that Schr{\textbackslash} odinger's equation can be abstractly formulated as characterising the Fourier transforms of certain Eilenberg-Moore morphisms from a quantum clock to a quantum dynamical system, and we use this to obtain a generalised version of the Feynman's clock construction. We tackle the issue of synchronism of clocks and systems, prove conservation of total energy and give conditions for the existence of an internal time observable for a quantum dynamical system. Finally, we identify our treatment as part of a more general theory of simulated symmetries of quantum systems (of which our clock actions are a special case) and their conservation laws (of which energy is a special case).},

	abstract = {A symmetric monoidal category naturally arises as the mathematical structure that organizes physical systems, processes, and composition thereof, both sequentially and in parallel. This structure admits a purely graphical calculus. This paper is concerned with the encoding of a fixed causal structure within a symmetric monoidal category: causal dependencies will correspond to topological connectedness in the graphical language. We show that correlations, either classical or quantum, force terminality of the tensor unit. We also show that well-definedness of the concept of a global state forces the monoidal product to be only partially defined, which in turn results in a relativistic covariance theorem. Except for these assumptions, at no stage do we assume anything more than purely compositional symmetric-monoidal categorical structure. We cast these two structural results in terms of a mathematical entity, which we call a `causal category'. We provide methods of constructing causal categories, and we study the consequences of these methods for the general framework of categorical quantum mechanics.},

Such loops are traditionally ruled out due to potential logical problems, e. g. , where an effect suppresses its own cause. Motivated by our current physical theories, we show that not only causal loops exist that are logically consistent, but that these loops are computationally tame and help to further investigate on the theoretical foundations of time travel. Causal loops do not necessarily pose problems from a logics, computer-science, and physics point of view. This opens their potential applicability in various fields from philosophy of language to computer science and physics.},

@misc{Vilasini2022,
	abstract = {Causality can be defined in terms of a space-time structure or based on information-theoretic structures, which correspond to very different notions of causation. When analysing physical experiments, these notions must be put together in a compatible manner. The process matrix framework describes quantum indefinite causal structures in the information-theoretic sense, but the physicality of such processes remains an open question. At the same time, there are several experiments in Minkowski spacetime (which implies a definite spacetime notion of causality) that claim to have implemented indefinite information-theoretic causal structures, suggesting an apparent tension between these notions. To address this, we develop a general framework that disentangles these two notions and characterises their compatibility in scenarios where quantum systems may be delocalised over a spacetime. The framework first describes a composition of quantum maps through feedback loops, and then the embedding of the resulting (possibly cyclic) signalling structure in an acyclic spacetime. Relativistic causality then corresponds to the compatibility of the two notions of causation. We reformulate the process matrix framework here and derive a number of no-go results for physical implementations of process matrices in a spacetime. These reveal that it is impossible to physically implement indefinite causal order processes with spacetime localised systems, and also characterise the degree to which they must be delocalised. Further, we show that any physical implementation of an indefinite order process can ultimately be fine-grained to one that admits a fixed acyclic information-theoretic causal order that is compatible with the spacetime causal order, thus resolving the apparent paradox. Our work sheds light on the operational meaning of indefinite causal structures which we discuss in detail.},

A wide variety of quantum phenomena are found to have analogues within this toy theory. Such phenomena include: the noncommutativity of measurements, interference, the multiplicity of convex decompositions of a mixed state, the impossibility of discriminating nonorthogonal states, the impossibility of a universal state inverter, the distinction between bi-partite and tri-partite entanglement, the monogamy of pure entanglement, no cloning, no broadcasting, remote steering, teleportation, dense coding, mutually unbiased bases, and many others. The diversity and quality of these analogies is taken as evidence for the view that quantum states are states of incomplete knowledge rather than states of reality. A consideration of the phenomena that the toy theory fails to reproduce, notably, violations of Bell inequalities and the existence of a Kochen-Specker theorem, provides clues for how to proceed with this research program.},

Indeed, such reasoning is a central part of the informal intuitive arguments used in the design of distributed protocols. Communication in a distributed system can be viewed as the act of transforming the system's state of knowledge. This paper presents a general framework for formalizing and reasoning about knowledge in distributed systems. We argue that states of knowledge of groups of processors are useful concepts for the design and analysis of distributed protocols. In particular, distributed knowledge corresponds to knowledge that is ``distributed'' among the members of the group, while common knowledge corresponds to a fact being ``publicly known''. The relationship between common knowledge and a variety of desirable actions in a distributed system is illustrated. Furthermore, it is shown that, formally speaking, in practical systems common knowledge cannot be attained. A number of weaker variants of common knowledge that are attainable in many cases of interest are introduced and investigated.},

Any attempt to do so in a realistic hidden-variable theory leads to values that are dependent upon the choice of the other (compatible) observables which are simultaneously measured (the measurement context). More formally, the measurement result (assumed pre-existing) of a quantum observable is dependent upon which other commuting observables are within the same measurement set.
Contextuality was first demonstrated to be a feature of quantum phenomenology by the Bell--Kochen--Specker theorem. The study of contextuality has developed into a major topic of interest in quantum foundations as the phenomenon crystallises certain non-classical and counter-intuitive aspects of quantum theory. A number of powerful mathematical frameworks have been developed to study and better understand contextuality, from the perspective of sheaf theory, graph theory, hypergraphs, algebraic topology, and probabilistic couplings.Nonlocality, in the sense of Bell's theorem, may be viewed as a special case of the more general phenomenon of contextuality, in which measurement contexts contain measurements that are distributed over spacelike separated regions. This follows from Fine's theorem.Quantum contextuality has been identified as a source of quantum computational speedups and quantum advantage in quantum computing. Contemporary research has increasingly focused on exploring its utility as a computational resource.},

@misc{Buhrman1998,
	abstract = {We present a simple and general simulation technique that transforms any black-box quantum algorithm (a la Grover's database search algorithm) to a quantum communication protocol for a related problem, in a way that fully exploits the quantum parallelism. This allows us to obtain new positive and negative results. The positive results are novel quantum communication protocols that are built from nontrivial quantum algorithms via this simulation. These protocols, combined with (old and new) classical lower bounds, are shown to provide the first asymptotic separation results between the quantum and classical (probabilistic) two-party communication complexity models. In particular, we obtain a quadratic separation for the bounded-error model, and an exponential separation for the zero-error model. The negative results transform known quantum communication lower bounds to computational lower bounds in the black-box model. In particular, we show that the quadratic speed-up achieved by Grover for the OR function is impossible for the PARITY function or the MAJORITY function in the bounded-error model, nor is it possible for the OR function itself in the exact case. This dichotomy naturally suggests a study of bounded-depth predicates (i.e. those in the polynomial hierarchy) between OR and MAJORITY. We present black-box algorithms that achieve near quadratic speed up for all such predicates.},

@misc{Dixit2021,
	abstract = {Silent Data Corruption (SDC) can have negative impact on large-scale infrastructure services. SDCs are not captured by error reporting mechanisms within a Central Processing Unit (CPU) and hence are not traceable at the hardware level. However, the data corruptions propagate across the stack and manifest as application-level problems. These types of errors can result in data loss and can require months of debug engineering time. In this paper, we describe common defect types observed in silicon manufacturing that leads to SDCs. We discuss a real-world example of silent data corruption within a datacenter application. We provide the debug flow followed to root-cause and triage faulty instructions within a CPU using a case study, as an illustration on how to debug this class of errors. We provide a high-level overview of the mitigations to reduce the risk of silent data corruptions within a large production fleet. In our large-scale infrastructure, we have run a vast library of silent error test scenarios across hundreds of thousands of machines in our fleet. This has resulted in hundreds of CPUs detected for these errors, showing that SDCs are a systemic issue across generations. We have monitored SDCs for a period longer than 18 months. Based on this experience, we determine that reducing silent data corruptions requires not only hardware resiliency and production detection mechanisms, but also robust fault-tolerant software architectures.},

	abstract = {We use the mathematical language of sheaf theory to give a unified treatment of non-locality and contextuality, in a setting which generalizes the familiar probability tables used in non-locality theory to arbitrary measurement covers; this includes Kochen-Specker configurations and more. We show that contextuality, and non-locality as a special case, correspond exactly to obstructions to the existence of global sections. We describe a linear algebraic approach to computing these obstructions, which allows a systematic treatment of arguments for non-locality and contextuality. We distinguish a proper hierarchy of strengths of no-go theorems, and show that three leading examples --- due to Bell, Hardy, and Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger, respectively --- occupy successively higher levels of this hierarchy. A general correspondence is shown between the existence of local hidden-variable realizations using negative probabilities, and no-signalling; this is based on a result showing that the linear subspaces generated by the non-contextual and no-signalling models, over an arbitrary measurement cover, coincide. Maximal non-locality is generalized to maximal contextuality, and characterized in purely qualitative terms, as the non-existence of global sections in the support. A general setting is developed for Kochen-Specker type results, as generic, model-independent proofs of maximal contextuality, and a new combinatorial condition is given, which generalizes the `parity proofs' commonly found in the literature. We also show how our abstract setting can be represented in quantum mechanics. This leads to a strengthening of the usual no-signalling theorem, which shows that quantum mechanics obeys no-signalling for arbitrary families of commuting observables, not just those represented on different factors of a tensor product.},

@article{Oreshkov2019,
	abstract = {It has been shown that it is theoretically possible for there to exist higher-order quantum processes in which the operations performed by separate parties cannot be ascribed a definite causal order. Some of these processes are believed to have a physical realization in standard quantum mechanics via coherent control of the times of the operations. A prominent example is the quantum SWITCH, which was recently demonstrated experimentally. However, the interpretation of such experiments as realizations of a process with indefinite causal structure as opposed to some form of simulation of such a process has remained controversial. Where exactly are the local operations of the parties in such an experiment? On what spaces do they act given that their times are indefinite? Can we probe them directly rather than assume what they ought to be based on heuristic considerations? How can we reconcile the claim that these operations really take place, each once as required, with the fact that the structure of the presumed process implies that they cannot be part of any acyclic circuit? Here, I offer a precise answer to these questions: the input and output systems of the operations in such a process are generally nontrivial subsystems of Hilbert spaces that are tensor products of Hilbert spaces associated with systems at different times---a fact that is directly experimentally verifiable. With respect to these time-delocalized subsystems, the structure of the process is one of a circuit with a causal cycle. I also identify a whole class of isometric processes, of which the quantum SWITCH is a special case, that admit a physical realization on time-delocalized subsystems. These results unveil a novel structure within quantum mechanics, which may have important implications for physics and information processing.},

This leaves open the identification of a principle that forbids non-causal correlations.

	abstract = {The formalism of generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs) was originally developed as a way to characterize the landscape of conceivable physical theories. Thus, the GPT describing a given physical theory necessarily includes all physically possible processes. We here consider the question of how to provide a GPT-like characterization of a particular experimental setup within a given physical theory. We show that the resulting characterization is not generally a GPT in and of itself-rather, it is described by a more general mathematical object that we introduce and term an accessible GPT fragment. We then introduce an equivalence relation, termed cone equivalence, between accessible GPT fragments (and, as a special case, between standard GPTs). We give a number of examples of experimental scenarios that are best described using accessible GPT fragments, and where moreover cone-equivalence arises naturally. We then prove that an accessible GPT fragment admits of a classical explanation if and only if every other fragment that is cone-equivalent to it also admits of a classical explanation. Finally, we leverage this result to prove several fundamental results regarding the experimental requirements for witnessing the failure of generalized noncontextuality. In particular, we prove that neither incompatibility among measurements nor the assumption of freedom of choice is necessary for witnessing failures of generalized noncontextuality, and, moreover, that such failures can be witnessed even using arbitrarily inefficient detectors.},

@misc{Wolpert2018,
	abstract = {There are (at least) four ways that an agent can acquire information concerning the state of the universe: via observation, control, prediction, or via retrodiction, i.e., memory. Each of these four ways of acquiring information seems to rely on a different kind of physical device (resp., an observation device, a control device, etc.). However it turns out that certain mathematical structure is common to those four types of device. Any device that possesses a certain subset of that structure is known as an  inference device  (ID). Here I review some of the properties of IDs, including their relation with Turing machines, and (more loosely) quantum mechanics. I also review the bounds of the joint abilities of any set of IDs to know facts about the physical universe that contains them. These bounds constrain the possible properties of any universe that contains agents who can acquire information concerning that universe. I then extend this previous work on IDs, by adding to the definition of IDs some of the other mathematical structure that is common to the four ways of acquiring information about the universe but is not captured in the (minimal) definition of IDs. I discuss these extensions of IDs in the context of epistemic logic (especially possible worlds formalisms like Kripke structures and Aumann structures). In particular, I show that these extensions of IDs are not subject to the problem of logical omniscience that plagues many previously studied forms of epistemic logic.},

	abstract = {Future quantum internet applications will derive their power from the ability to share quantum information across the network1,2. Quantum teleportation allows for the reliable transfer of quantum information between distant nodes, even in the presence of highly lossy network connections3. Although many experimental demonstrations have been performed on different quantum network platforms4--10, moving beyond directly connected nodes has, so far, been hindered by the demanding requirements on the pre-shared remote entanglement, joint qubit readout and coherence times. Here we realize quantum teleportation between remote, non-neighbouring nodes in a quantum network. The network uses three optically connected nodes based on solid-state spin qubits. The teleporter is prepared by establishing remote entanglement on the two links, followed by entanglement swapping on the middle node and storage in a memory qubit. We demonstrate that, once successful preparation of the teleporter is heralded, arbitrary qubit states can be teleported with fidelity above the classical bound, even with unit efficiency. These results are enabled by key innovations in the qubit readout procedure, active memory qubit protection during entanglement generation and tailored heralding that reduces remote entanglement infidelities. Our work demonstrates a prime building block for future quantum networks and opens the door to exploring teleportation-based multi-node protocols and applications2,11--13.},

Almost all software engineers claim to have read it. Many who haven't read it, use (and basically understand) the fundamental idea of logical clocks, and their progeny (vector clocks, matrix clocks, etc.). More than a few understand the current state of the art: dotted version vectors and bounded version vectors. Paradoxically, almost everyone missed some of the more subtle concepts, and questions that Lamport introduced in this paper. In the intervening years. Progress has occurred, and the state of the art has evolved. This talk is therefore in three parts. The first being a review of the paper itself, the concepts it introduced, and the assumptions behind these concepts. The second part reflects what we've learned in the intervening years, and especially the relationship of Lamport's (original) understanding of time, which was superior to almost all other computer scientists at the time, and what (in contrast) we know now. The third part will be entirely devoted to questions and answers: Where anyone can ask a question, and anyone can try to answer it.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Master equations are commonly used to model the dynamics of physical systems, including systems that implement single-valued functions like a computer's update step. However, many such functions cannot be implemented by any master equation, even approximately, which raises the question of how they can occur in the real world. Here we show how any function over some ``visible'' states can be implemented with master equation dynamics---if the dynamics exploits additional, ``hidden'' states at intermediate times. We also show that any master equation implementing a function can be decomposed into a sequence of ``hidden'' timesteps, demarcated by changes in what state-to-state transitions have nonzero probability. In many real-world situations there is a cost both for more hidden states and for more hidden timesteps. Accordingly, we derive a ``space--time'' tradeoff between the number of hidden states and the number of hidden timesteps needed to implement any given function.},

	abstract = {The idea that events obey a definite causal order is deeply rooted in our understanding of the world and at the basis of the very notion of time. But where does causal order come from, and is it a necessary property of nature? We address these questions from the standpoint of quantum mechanics in a new framework for multipartite correlations which does not assume a pre-defined global causal structure but only the validity of quantum mechanics locally. All known situations that respect causal order, including space-like and time-like separated experiments, are captured by this framework in a unified way. Surprisingly, we find correlations that cannot be understood in terms of definite causal order. These correlations violate a 'causal inequality' that is satisfied by all space-like and time-like correlations. We further show that in a classical limit causal order always arises, which suggests that space-time may emerge from a more fundamental structure in a quantum-to-classical transition.},

@article{Aaronson2022,
	abstract = {I survey, for a general scientific audience, three decades of research into which sorts of problems admit exponential speedups via quantum computers -- from the classics (like the algorithms of Simon and Shor), to the breakthrough of Yamakawa and Zhandry from April 2022. I discuss both the quantum circuit model, which is what we ultimately care about in practice but where our knowledge is radically incomplete, and the so-called oracle or black-box or query complexity model, where we've managed to achieve a much more thorough understanding that then informs our conjectures about the circuit model. I discuss the strengths and weaknesses of switching attention to sampling tasks, as was done in the recent quantum supremacy experiments. I make some skeptical remarks about widely-repeated claims of exponential quantum speedups for practical machine learning and optimization problems. Through many examples, I try to convey the  law of conservation of weirdness,  according to which every problem admitting an exponential quantum speedup must have some unusual property to allow the amplitude to be concentrated on the unknown right answer(s).},

@misc{Adlam2022,
	abstract = {In this article we set out to understand the significance of the process matrix formalism and the quantum causal modelling programme for ongoing disputes about the role of causation in fundamental physics. We argue that the process matrix programme has correctly identified a notion of 'causal order' which plays an important role in fundamental physics, but this notion is weaker than the common-sense conception of causation because it does not involve asymmetry. We argue that causal order plays an important role in grounding more familiar causal phenomena. Then we apply these conclusions to the causal modelling programme within quantum foundations, arguing that since no-signalling quantum correlations cannot exhibit causal order, they should not be analysed using classical causal models. This resolves an open question about how to interpret fine-tuning in classical causal models of no-signalling correlations. Finally we observe that a quantum generalization of causal modelling can play a similar functional role to standard causal reasoning, but we emphasize that this functional characterisation does not entail that quantum causal models offer novel explanations of quantum processes.},

However, the standard definition of op-based CRDTs is very encompassing, allowing even sending the full-state, blurring the distinction. We introduce pure op-based CRDTs, that can only send operations to other replicas, drawing a clear distinction from state-based ones. Datatypes with commutative operations can be trivially implemented as pure op-based CRDTs using standard reliable causal delivery. We propose an extended API -- tagged reliable causal broadcast -- that provides causality information upon delivery, and show how it can be used to also implement other datatypes having non-commutative operations, through the use of a PO-Log -- a partially ordered log of operations -- inside the datatype. A semantically-based PO-Log compaction framework, using both causality and what we denote by causal stability, allows obtaining very compact replica state for pure op-based CRDTs, while also benefiting from small message sizes.},

This leads to enterprise networks that are inflexible, fragile, and difficult to manage. To address these limitations, we offer SANE, a protection architecture for enterprise networks. SANE defines a single protection layer that governs all connectivity within the enterprise. All routing and access control decisions are made by a logically-centralized server that grants access to services by handing out capabilities (encrypted source routes) according to declarative access control policies (e.g.,  Alice can access http server foo ). Capabilities are enforced at each switch, which are simple and only minimally trusted. SANE offers strong attack resistance and containment in the face of compromise, yet is practical for everyday use. Our prototype implementation shows that SANE could be deployed in current networks with only a few modifications, and it can easily scale to networks of tens of thousands of nodes.},

The violation of a Bell inequality, however, does not exclude classical models where some level of measurement dependence is allowed, that is, the choice made by observers can be correlated with the source generating the systems to be measured. Here, we show that the level of measurement dependence can be quantitatively upper bounded if we arrange the Bell test within a network. Furthermore, we also prove that these results can be adapted in order to derive nonlinear Bell inequalities for a large class of causal networks and to identify quantumly realizable correlations that violate them.},

	abstract = {We propose four information-theoretic axioms for the foundations of statistical mechanics in general physical theories. The axioms---Causality, Purity Preservation, Pure Sharpness, and Purification---identify a class of theories where every mixed state can be modelled as the marginal of a pure entangled state and where every unsharp measurement can be modelled as a sharp measurement on a composite system. This class of theories, called sharp theories with purification, includes quantum theory both with complex and real amplitudes, as well as a suitable extension of classical probability theory where classical systems can be entangled with other, non-classical systems. Theories satisfying our axioms support well-behaved notions of majorization, entropy, and Gibbs states, allowing for an information-theoretic derivation of Landauer's principle. We conjecture that every theory admitting a sensible thermodynamics must be extendable to a sharp theory with purification.},

	abstract = {Cluster fabric interconnects that use 3D torus topologies are increasingly being deployed in data center clusters. In our prior work, we demonstrated that by using these topologies and letting applications implement custom routing protocols and perform operations on path, it is possible to increase performance and simplify development. However, these benefits cannot be achieved using mainstream point-to-point networking stacks such as TCP/IP or MPI, which hide the underlying topology and do not allow the implementation of any in-network operations. In this paper we describe CamCubeOS, a novel key-based communication stack, purposely designed from scratch for 3D torus fabric interconnects. We note that many of the applications used in clusters are key-based. Therefore, we designed CamCubeOS to natively support key-based operations. We select a virtual topology that perfectly matches the underlying physical topology and we use the keyspace to expose the physical locality, thus avoiding the typical overhead incurred by overlay-based approaches. We report on our experience in building several applications on top of CamCubeOS and we evaluate their performance and feasibility using a prototype and large-scale simulations.},

However, if there is a bound on the rate at which a processor can generate messages, then we show that clock synchronization is achievable, without authentication, as long as the faults do not disconnect the network.

	abstract = {Chaotic systems are highly sensitive to a small perturbation, be they biological, chemical, classical, ecological, political, or quantum. Taking this as the underlying principle, we construct an operational notion for quantum chaos. Namely, we demand that the whole future state of a large, isolated quantum system is highly sensitive to past multitime operations on a small subpart of that system. This immediately leads to a direct link between quantum chaos and volume-law spatiotemporal entanglement. Remarkably, our operational criterion already contains the routine notions, as well as the well-known diagnostics for quantum chaos. This includes the Peres-Loschmidt Echo, Dynamical Entropy, and Out-of-Time-Order Correlators. Our principle therefore unifies these existing diagnostics within a single structure. Within this framework, we also go on to quantify how several mechanisms lead to quantum chaos, such as unitary designs. Our work paves the way to systematically study exotic many-body dynamical phenomena like Many-Body Localisation, many-body scars, measurement-induced phase transitions, and Floquet dynamics. We anticipate that our work may lead to a clear link between the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis and quantum chaos.},

	abstract = {The reversible computation paradigm aims to provide a new foundation for general classical digital computing that is capable of circumventing the thermodynamic limits to the energy efficiency of the conventional, non-reversible digital paradigm. However, to date, the essential rationale for and analysis of classical reversible computing (RC) has not yet been expressed in terms that leverage the modern formal methods of non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics (NEQT). In this paper, we begin developing an NEQT-based foundation for the physics of reversible computing. We use the framework of Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad dynamics (a.k.a. Lindbladians) with multiple asymptotic states, incorporating recent results from resource theory, full counting statistics, and stochastic thermodynamics. Important conclusions include that, as expected: (1) Landauer's Principle indeed sets a strict lower bound on entropy generation in traditional non-reversible architectures for deterministic computing machines when we account for the loss of correlations; and (2) implementations of the alternative reversible computation paradigm can potentially avoid such losses, and thereby circumvent the Landauer limit, potentially allowing the efficiency of future digital computing technologies to continue improving indefinitely. We also outline a research plan for identifying the fundamental minimum energy dissipation of reversible computing machines as a function of speed.},

@article{Gans2019,
	abstract = {Research Summary This paper develops an integrated framework linking the nature of the entrepreneurial choice process to the foundations of entrepreneurial strategy. Because entrepreneurs face many alternatives that cannot be pursued at once, entrepreneurs must adopt (implicitly or explicitly) a process for choosing among entrepreneurial strategies. The interplay between uncertainty and learning has the consequence that commitment-free analysis yields multiple, equally viable alternatives from which one must be chosen. This endogenous gap between optimization and choice is a central paradox confronting entrepreneurs. Resolving this allows for a reformulation of the foundations of entrepreneurial strategy, emphasizing the role of choice rather than the centrality of the strategic environment. Managerial Summary The central strategic challenge for an entrepreneur is how to choose: entrepreneurs often face multiple potential strategies for commercializing their idea but due to the constraint of limited resources, cannot pursue them all at once. At the same time, entrepreneurs are venturing into new domains and as such, must choose under conditions of high uncertainty with only noisy learning available. This paper explores the interplay between these unique conditions that shape the entrepreneurial choice process, finding that often, the process will not yield a single best strategy but instead several equally attractive strategic alternatives. A key implication is that entrepreneurs cannot simply choose what not to do, but instead must proactively decide which equally viable alternatives to leave behind when choosing an entrepreneurial strategy.},

As an illustrative example, we show how a special case of this algorithm enables highly efficient automated simplification of quantum circuits, as represented in the ZX-calculus.},

	abstract = {We discuss the problem of routing messages on hypercubes which have faulty processors and/or communication links. We are motivated by the belief that simple algorithms, operating under simple assumptions, can ensure high probabilities of successful message routing. In this paper, we consider the basic problem of routing a single message from an arbitrary source to an arbitrary destination. In our study, a fault is assumed to render the processor or link non-functional for purposes of communicating messages. As such, we may also consider communications hot spots as node faults, and our results also apply to routing in congested hypercubes. A framework for the analysis of fault tolerant routing schemes on a hypercube is presented. This framework includes differing routing schemes, routing information models and fault distribution models. The a priori probabilities of successful routing of a single, indivisible message under each of our possible sets of assumptions are calculated. Using random routing, under the one-step local information routing model, we show that the a priori probability of successful message routing is high even for an exceedingly large number of faults. We also analyze the behavior of sidetracking, a routing method which combines the concepts of local information and randomization. Using sidetracking, and in the one-step local information routing model, a message will be routed forward using random routing. If the message reaches a blocked processor (no non-faulty neighbors along a minimal path to the destination) it will be sent to a non-faulty neighbor, chosen uniformly at random from the set of non-faulty neighbors. We use simulation experiments to determine the performance of this routing scheme, analyzing the probability of successful routing and the expected path length of a routed message. The empirical performance of the sidetracking algorithms indicates strongly that, in the limit as the cube dimension grows larger and for a fixed probability of node failure, the probability of successful message routing is 100\%.},

	abstract = {Use-after-free vulnerabilities remain difficult to detect and mitigate, making them a popular source of exploitation. Existing solutions incur impractical performance/memory overhead, require specialized hardware, and/or guarantee only protection, but not detection. In this paper, we propose DangZero, a new solution to detect use-after-free vulnerabilities as they occur. DangZero builds on a traditional page protection and aliasing scheme, where objects are made inaccessible after a free, and subsequent accesses are immediately detected. In contrast to prior solutions using alias-based detection, DangZero relies on direct page table access in ring 0 to provide a much more efficient implementation. The key idea is that, by giving the program's allocator direct access to the page tables, we can efficiently manage and invalidate vulnerable objects. To safely implement this, we build upon a unikernel-like design, where virtualization provides ring-0 (guest-mode) access, isolation, as well as compatibility with existing Linux programs. Moreover, we show direct page table access serves as an efficient building block for garbage collection-style alias reclaiming. Doing so provides the ability to safely reuse freed areas and address the scalability issues plaguing state-of-the-art alias-based solutions. Our experimental results confirm that DangZero provides accurate detection guarantees with significantly lower overhead than competing stateof-the-art solutions (e.g., 18\% saturated throughput degradation on long-running programs such as the Nginx web server).},

@book{Groth2005,
	abstract = {In voting based on homomorphic threshold encryption, the voter encrypts his vote and sends it in to the authorities that tally the votes. If voters can send in arbitrary plaintexts then they can cheat. It is therefore important that they attach an argument of knowledge of the plaintext being a correctly formed vote. Typically, these arguments are honest verifier zero-knowledge arguments that are made non-interactive using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic. Security is argued in the random oracle model.
The simplest case is where each voter has a single vote to cast. Practical solutions have already been suggested for the single vote case. However, as we shall see homomorphic threshold encryption can be used for a variety of elections, in particular there are many cases where voters can cast multiple votes at once. In these cases, it remains important to bring down the cost of the NIZK argument.
We improve on state of the art in the case of limited votes, where each voter can vote a small number of times. We also improve on the state of the art in shareholder elections, where each voter may have a large number of votes to spend. Moreover, we improve on the state of the art in Borda voting. Finally, we suggest a NIZK argument for correctness of an approval vote. To the best of our knowledge, approval voting has not been considered before in the cryptographic literature.},

We prove a prominent conjecture by Brown and Susskind about how random quantum circuits' complexity increases. Consider constructing a unitary from Haar-random two-qubit quantum gates. Implementing the unitary exactly requires a circuit of some minimal number of gates - the unitary's exact circuit complexity. We prove that this complexity grows linearly with the number of random gates, with unit probability, until saturating after exponentially many random gates. Our proof is surprisingly short, given the established difficulty of lower-bounding the exact circuit complexity. Our strategy combines differential topology and elementary algebraic geometry with an inductive construction of Clifford circuits.},

The algorithms tolerate both link and node failures of any type. The algorithm for maintaining synchronization will work for arbitrary networks (rather than just completely connected networks) and tolerates any number of processor or communication link faults as long as the correct processors remain connected by fault-free paths. It thus represents an improvement over other clock synchronization algorithms such as [LM1,LM2,LL1]. Our algorithm for allowing new processors to join requires that more than half the processors be correct, a requirement which is provably necessary.},

@article{Hoffman2023,
	abstract = {What are conscious experiences? Can they combine to form new experiences? What are conscious subjects? Can they combine to form new subjects? Most attempts to answer these questions assume that spacetime, and some of its particles, are fundamental. However, physicists tell us that spacetime cannot be fundamental. Spacetime, they say, is doomed. We heed the physicists, and drop the assumption that spacetime is fundamental. We assume instead that subjects and experiences are entities beyond spacetime, not within spacetime. We make this precise in a mathematical theory of conscious agents, whose dynamics are described by Markov chains. We show how (1) agents combine into more complex agents, (2) agents fuse into simpler agents, and (3) qualia fuse to create new qualia. The possible dynamics of n agents form an n(n−1)-dimensional polytope with nn vertices---the Markov polytopeMn. The total fusions of n agents and qualia form an (n−1)-dimensional simplex---the fusion simplexFn. To project the Markovian dynamics of conscious agents onto scattering processes in spacetime, we define a new map from Markov chains to decorated permutations. Such permutations---along with helicities, or masses and spins---invariantly encode all physical information used to compute scattering amplitudes. We propose that spacetime and scattering processes are a data structure that codes for interactions of conscious agents: a particle in spacetime is a projection of the Markovian dynamics of a communicating class of conscious agents.},

This paper provides a solution by describing simple rules that characterize discrete Lorentz boosts between 4D lattice graphs, which combine further to form Wigner rotations that produce isotropy and lead to the emergence of the continuous Lorentz group and the (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski-spacetime. On such graphs, the speed of light, the proper time interval, as well as the proper length are all shown to be highly accurate.},

	abstract = {Full system  end-to-end  measurements in physical testbeds are the gold standard for network systems evaluation but are often not feasible. When physical testbeds are not available we frequently turn to simulation for evaluation. Unfortunately, existing simulators are insufficient for end-to-end evaluation, as they either cannot simulate all components, or simulate them with inadequate detail. We address this through modular simulation, flexibly combining and connecting multiple existing simulators for different components, including processor and memory, devices, and network, into virtual end-to-end testbeds tuned for each use-case. Our architecture, SimBricks, combines well-defined component interfaces for extensibility and modularity, efficient communication channels for local and distributed simulation, and a co-designed efficient synchronization mechanism for accurate timing across simulators. We demonstrate SimBricks scales to 1000 simulated hosts, each running a full software stack including Linux, and that it can simulate testbeds with existing NIC and switch RTL implementations. We also reproduce key findings from prior work in congestion control, NIC architecture, and in-network computing in SimBricks.},

@inproceedings{Luo2007,
	abstract = {We recently published our proposal for Ethane: A clean- slate approach to managing and securing enterprise networks. The goal of Ethane is to make enterprise networks (e.g. networks in companies, universities, and home offices) much easier to manage. Ethane is built on the premise that the only way to manage and secure networks is to make sure we can identify the origin of all traffic, and hold someone (or some machine) accountable for it. So first, Ethane authenticates every human, computer and switch in the network, and tracks them at all times. Every packet can be immediately identified with its sender. Second, Ethane implements a network-wide policy language in terms of users, machines and services. Before a flow is allowed into the network, it is checked against the policy. Ethane requires two substantial changes to the network: Network switches and routers are replaced with much simpler switches, which are based on flow tables. The switch doesn't learn addresses, doesn't run spanning tree, routing protocols or any access control lists. All it does is permit or deny flows under the control of a central controller. The controller is the second big change. Each network contains a central controller that decides if a flow is to be allowed into the network. It makes its decisions based on a set of rules that make up a policy. One premise of Ethane is that although the network is much more powerful as a whole, the switches are much simpler than conventional switches and routers. To explore whether this is true, we built 4-port Ethane switches in dedicated hardware (on the NetFPGA platform), running at 1Gb/s per port. We have deployed the switches in our network at Stanford University, and demonstrated that despite the simplicity of the switches, Ethane can support a very feature-rich and easy-to-manage network.},

	abstract = {All current formulations of thermodynamics invoke some form of coarse-graining or ensembles as the supposed link between their own laws and the microscopic laws of motion. They deal only with ensemble-averages, expectation values, macroscopic limits, infinite heat baths, etc., not with the details of physical variables of individual microscopic systems. They are consistent with the laws of motion for finite systems only in certain approximations, which improve with increasing scale, given various assumptions about initial conditions which are neither specified precisely nor even thought to hold exactly in nature. Here I propose a new formulation of the zeroth, first and second laws, improving upon the axiomatic approach to thermodynamics (Carath{\textbackslash}'eodory, 1909; Lieb \& Yngvason, 1999), via the principles of the recently proposed constructor theory. Specifically, I provide a non-approximative, scale-independent formulation of 'adiabatic accessibility'; this in turn provides a non-approximative, scale-independent distinction between work and heat and reveals an unexpected connection between information theory and the first law of thermodynamics (not just the second). It also achieves the long-sought unification of the axiomatic approach with Kelvin's.},

In this paper, we show that removing exponential backoff from TCP altogether can be done without inducing any stability side-effects. We introduce the implicit packet conservation principle and show that as long as the endpoints uphold this principle, they can only improve their end-to-end performance relative to the exponential backoff case. By conducting large-scale simulations, modeling, and network experiments in Emulab and the Internet using a kernel-level FreeBSD TCP implementation, realistic traffic distributions, and complex network topologies, we demonstrate that TCP's binary exponential backoff mechanism can be safely removed. Moreover, we show that insuitability of TCP's exponential backoff is fundamental, i.e., independent from the currently-dominant Internet traffic properties or bottleneck capacities. Surprisingly, our results indicate that a path to incrementally deploying the change does exist.},

Some of these topologies also allow the designer considerable freedom to set parameters (for example, the number of ports on a switch, link bandwidths, or switch-to-switch wiring patterns) at design time. This freedom of choice, however, requires the designer to balance among bandwidth, latency, reliability, parts cost, and other real-world details. Designers need help in exploring this design space, and especially in finding optimal network designs. We describe the specific challenges that designers face, and we present Perseus, a framework for quickly guiding a network designer to a small set of candidate designs. We identify several optimization problems that can be accommodated within this framework, and present solution algorithms for many of these problems.},

	abstract = {To realize the full potential of quantum technologies, finding good strategies to control quantum information processing devices in real time becomes increasingly important. Usually these strategies require a precise understanding of the device itself, which is generally not available. Model-free reinforcement learning circumvents this need by discovering control strategies from scratch without relying on an accurate description of the quantum system. Furthermore, important tasks like state preparation, gate teleportation and error correction need feedback at time scales much shorter than the coherence time, which for superconducting circuits is in the microsecond range. Developing and training a deep reinforcement learning agent able to operate in this real-time feedback regime has been an open challenge. Here, we have implemented such an agent in the form of a latency-optimized deep neural network on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). We demonstrate its use to efficiently initialize a superconducting qubit into a target state. To train the agent, we use model-free reinforcement learning that is based solely on measurement data. We study the agent's performance for strong and weak measurements, and for three-level readout, and compare with simple strategies based on thresholding. This demonstration motivates further research towards adoption of reinforcement learning for real-time feedback control of quantum devices and more generally any physical system requiring learnable low-latency feedback control.},

	abstract = {The exponential growth of the power of modern digital computers is based upon the miniaturisation of vast nanoscale arrays of electronic switches, but this will be eventually constrained by fabrication limits and power dissipation. Chemical processes have the potential to scale beyond these limits performing computations through chemical reactions, yet the lack of well-defined programmability limits their scalability and performance. We present a hybrid digitally programmable chemical array as a probabilistic computational machine that uses chemical oscillators partitioned in interconnected cells as a computational substrate. This hybrid architecture performs efficient computation by distributing between chemical and digital domains together with error correction. The efficiency is gained by combining digital with probabilistic chemical logic based on nearest neighbour interactions and hysteresis effects. We demonstrated the implementation of one- and two- dimensional Chemical Cellular Automata and solutions to combinatorial optimization problems.},

	abstract = {Strongly consistent systems supporting distributed transactions can be prone to high latency and do not tolerate partitions. The present trend of using weaker forms of consistency, to achieve high availability, poses notable challenges in writing applications due to the lack of linearizability, e.g., to ensure global invariants, or perform mutator operations on a distributed datatype. This paper addresses a specific problem: the exactly-once transfer of a  quantity  from one node to another on an unreliable network (coping with message duplication, loss, or reordering) and without any form of global synchronization. This allows preserving a global property (the sum of quantities remains unchanged) without requiring global linearizability and only through using pairwise interactions between nodes, therefore allowing partitions in the system. We present the novel quantity-transfer algorithm while focusing on a specific use-case: a redistribution protocol to keep the quantities in a set of nodes balanced, in particular, averaging a shared real number across nodes. Since this is a work in progress, we briefly discuss the correctness of the protocol, and we leave potential extensions and empirical evaluations for future work.},

@inproceedings{Tootaghaj2022,
	abstract = {This paper proposes a new architecture that strategically harvests the untapped compute capacity of the SmartNICs to offload transient microservices workload spikes, thereby reducing the SLA violations while providing better performance/energy consumption. This is particularly important for ML workloads at Edge deployments with stringent SLA requirements. Usage of the untapped compute capacity is more favorable than deploying extra servers, as SmartNICs are economically and operationally more desirable. We propose SpikeOffload, a low-cost and scalable platform that leverages machine learning to predict the spikes and orchestrates seamless offloading of generic microservices workloads to the SmartNICs, eliminating the need for pre-deploying expensive host servers and their underutilization. Our SpikeOffload evaluation shows that SLA violations can be reduced by up to 20\% for specific workloads. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for specific workloads our approach can potentially reduce capital expenditure (CAPEX) by more than 40\%. Also, performance per unit energy consumption can be improved by upto 2×.},

@misc{ToudehFallah2022,
	abstract = {This article describes experimental research studies conducted towards understanding the implementation aspects of high-capacity quantum-secured optical channels in mission-critical metro-scale operational environments based on Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) technology. The test bed for this research study was carefully designed to mimic such environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an 800 Gbps quantum-secured optical channel--along with several other Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexed (DWDM) channels on the C-band and multiplexed with the QKD channel on the O-band--was established at distances up to 100 km, with secure-key rates relevant for practical industry use cases. In addition, during the course of these trials, transporting a blockchain application over this established channel was utilized as a demonstration of securing a financial transaction in transit over a quantum-secured optical channel. In a real-world operational environment, deployment of such high-capacity quantum-secured optical channels multiplexed with the quantum channel will inevitably introduce challenges due to their strict requirements, such as high launch powers and polarization fluctuations. Therefore, in the course of this research, experimental studies were conducted on the impact on the system performance--and specifically on the quantum channel--of several degradation factors present in real-world operational environments, including inter-channel interference (due to Raman scattering and nonlinear effects), attenuation, polarization fluctuations and distance dependency. The findings of this research pave the way towards the deployment of QKD-secured optical channels in high-capacity, metro-scale, mission-critical operational environments, such as Inter-Data Center Interconnects.},

@article{Trudgill2005,
	abstract = {This paper (i) reviews temperature/development rate relationships in plants and poikilothermic invertebrates, (ii) argues that the relationship is often linear over much of the range up to the thermal optimum (To) and provides a possible mechanism, (iii) provides evidence of a trade-off between the base temperature (Tb) and the thermal constant (DD) that enables each species to adapt to its thermal environment, and (iv) indicates some of the practical and ecological implications. Where a linear relationship has been characterised it is possible to estimate the base temperature for development (Tb, expressed in $\,^{\circ}$C) and the thermal constant for development (DD, the reciprocal of the temperature coefficient (a), expressed in degree [$\,^{\circ}$C] days accumulated above Tb). A possible basis for the linear relationship between rate and temperature is proposed based on the Arrhenius and Sharpe-Schoolfield equations involving activation enthalpy and progressive inactivation of the reactant molecules at both low and high temperatures. Knowledge of Tb and DD enables rates of development of organisms/processes to be calculated and compared at any given temperature between Tb and To. An analysis of published results for differentiation processes (differentiation = a change of state) in species of insects, Collembola, spiders, nematodes and plants showed that Tb tended to vary with the temperature of the niche to which the organism is adapted, and that there was a trade-off between Tb and DD. Tropical species had higher values of Tb than temperate and DD decreased as Tb increased (and vice versa). This conferred a competitive advantage on each species in the thermal environment to which it was adapted. The decrease in DD tended to be relatively greater than the increase in Tb, further favouring a high Tb in tropical species. A mechanism for the trade-off is suggested whereby DD and Tb were shown to be correlated (P {\textless} 0.01) with the activation enthalpy (HA) of an assumed, rate-limiting enzyme. Thermal time can also be applied to processes involving growth (= an increase in dry weight) when the DD requirement for development to maturity is the sum of the requirements for differentiation and growth. Rates of both differentiation and growth can vary greatly between species, depending upon the niche they inhabit, and the implications of such differences for resource requirements are considered. In insects and nematodes, but not in annual plants, development is usually coupled to growth. Consequently, when resources are inadequate, mature size in these animals varies less than in plants. Thermal time is shown to provide insight into the life strategies of species within their communities and to have practical implications.},

@misc{Aerts2022,
	abstract = {As a result of the identification of 'identity' and 'indistinguishability' and strong experimental evidence for the presence of the associated Bose-Einstein statistics in human cognition and language, we argued in previous work for an extension of the research domain of quantum cognition. In addition to quantum complex vector spaces and quantum probability models, we showed that quantization itself, with words as quanta, is relevant and potentially important to human cognition. In the present work, we build on this result, and introduce a powerful radiation quantization scheme for human cognition. We show that the lack of independence of the Bose-Einstein statistics compared to the Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics can be explained by the presence of a 'meaning dynamics', which causes words to be attracted to the same words. And so words clump together in the same states, a phenomenon well known for photons in the early years of quantum mechanics, leading to fierce disagreements between Planck and Einstein. Using a simple example, we introduce all the elements to get a better and detailed view of this 'meaning dynamics', such as micro and macro states, and Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac numbers and weights, and compare this example and its graphs, with the radiation quantization scheme of a Winnie the Pooh story, also with its graphs. By connecting a concept directly to human experience, we show that entanglement is a necessity for preserving the 'meaning dynamics' we identified, and it becomes clear in what way Fermi-Dirac addresses human memory. Within the human mind, as a crucial aspect of memory, in spaces with internal parameters, identical words can nevertheless be assigned different states and hence realize locally and contextually the necessary distinctiveness, structured by a Pauli exclusion principle, for human thought to thrive.},

@misc{Wiseman2015,
	abstract = {Bell's theorem can refer to two different theorems that John Bell proved, the first in 1964 and the second in 1976. His 1964 theorem is the incompatibility of quantum phenomena with the joint assumptions of Locality and Predetermination. His 1976 theorem is their incompatibility with the single property of Local Causality. This is contrary to Bell's own later assertions, that his 1964 theorem began with the assumption of Local Causality, even if not by that name. Although the two Bell's theorems are logically equivalent, their assumptions are not. Hence, the earlier and later theorems suggest quite different conclusions, embraced by operationalists and realists, respectively. The key issue is whether Locality or Local Causality is the appropriate notion emanating from Relativistic Causality, and this rests on one's basic notion of causation. For operationalists the appropriate notion is what is here called the Principle of Agent-Causation, while for realists it is Reichenbach's Principle of common cause. By breaking down the latter into even more basic Postulates, it is possible to obtain a version of Bell's theorem in which each camp could reject one assumption, happy that the remaining assumptions reflect its weltanschauung. Formulating Bell's theorem in terms of causation is fruitful not just for attempting to reconcile the two camps, but also for better describing the ontology of different quantum interpretations and for more deeply understanding the implications of Bell's marvellous work.},

This is intended to be an idealization of what happens in multiple access networks, such as the Ethernet. We then consider tradeoffs between the type and number of broadcasts, and the tightness of synchronization. Our results include (1) matching upper and lower bounds of (1+1/K)ε on the precision of clock synchronization attainable forn≧3 process usingK (n−1)-casts, 3≦K≦n, (2) matching upper and lower bounds of (1+1/n)ε on the precision of clock synchronization attainable forn≧3 processes using an arbitrary number of (n−1)-casts, and (3) matching upper and lower bounds of (1+n−2/n)ε on the precision attainable using 2-casting.},

Although it includes conjectured laws of physics that are directly about information, independently of the details of particular physical instantiations, it does not regard information as an a priori mathematical or logical concept, but as something whose nature and properties are determined by the laws of physics alone. It does not suffer from the circularity at the foundations of existing information theory (namely that information and distinguishability are each defined in terms of the other). It explains the relationship between classical and quantum information, and reveals the single, constructor-theoretic property underlying the most distinctive phenomena associated with the latter, including the lack of in-principle distinguishability of some states, the impossibility of cloning, the existence of pairs of variables that cannot simultaneously have sharp values, the fact that measurement processes can be both deterministic and unpredictable, the irreducible perturbation caused by measurement, and entanglement (locally inaccessible information).},

Our design uses a single antenna for simultaneous TX/RX (i.e., the same resources as a standard half duplex system). We also propose novel analog and digital cancellation techniques that cancel the self interference to the receiver noise floor, and therefore ensure that there is no degradation to the received signal. We prototype our design by building our own analog circuit boards and integrating them with a fully WiFi-PHY compatible software radio implementation. We show experimentally that our design works robustly in noisy indoor environments, and provides close to the expected theoretical doubling of throughput in practice.},

@article{Bennett1973,
	abstract = {The usual general-purpose computing automaton (e.g., a Turing machine) is logically irreversible---its transition function lacks a single-valued inverse. Here it is shown that such machines may be made logically reversible at every step, while retaining their simplicity and their ability to do general computations. This result is of great physical interest because it makes plausible the existence of thermodynamically reversible computers which could perform useful computations at useful speed while dissipating considerably less than kT of energy per logical step. In the first stage of its computation the logically reversible automaton parallels the corresponding irreversible automaton, except that it saves all intermediate results, thereby avoiding the irreversible operation of erasure. The second stage consists of printing out the desired output. The third stage then reversibly disposes of all the undesired intermediate results by retracing the steps of the first stage in backward order (a process which is only possible because the first stage has been carried out reversibly), thereby restoring the machine (except for the now-written output tape) to its original condition. The final machine configuration thus contains the desired output and a reconstructed copy of the input, but no other undesired data. The foregoing results are demonstrated explicitly using a type of three-tape Turing machine. The biosynthesis of messenger RNA is discussed as a physical example of reversible computation.},

	abstract = {In a local-first architecture that prioritizes availability in the presence of network partitions, there is a tension between two goals: merging concurrent changes without user intervention and maintaining data integrity constraints. We propose a synchronization model called forking histories which satisfies both goals in an unconventional way. In the case of conflicting writes, the model exposes multiple event histories that users can see and edit rather than converging to a single state. This allows integrity constraints to be maintained within each history while giving users flexibility in deciding when to manually reconcile conflicts. We describe a class of applications for which these integrity constraints are particularly important and propose a design for a system that implements this model.},

@book{Burgess2022,
	abstract = {This discussion is aimed at a mixed audience of social theorists and physicists. It proposes to use a formalization of 'trust' as an interaction potential for predicting social behaviours-analogous to the use of energy in physics. It builds on details previously established for virtual processes. Progress in physics advanced quickly once the concept of energy was developed as a unifying exchange currency in interactions. An analogous approach, suitable for large or small scale modelling, is proposed here for social sciences, based on the formal notions of trust from Promise Theory. In the absence of a comprehensive physics of socioeconomic systems, many authors have used analogies with the physics of elementary phenomena as a way of reasoning, without an obvious justification for making the analogy. In this note, this approach is largely justified and expanded upon. By introducing a formal measure of trust as an interchange currency (analogous to energy or money) we can quantify interactions and sketch out a manifesto with simple examples for future study. Unlike some analogous uses of physical models, we are not limited to a mean field or statistical coarse-grained limit. Promise Theory graph dynamics provides an detailed and intimate underpinning for such approximations and connects to Game Theory in a mesoscopic limit. The key insight is that the semantics of trust are the essential accounting parameter that unifies the different pictures, as demonstrated earlier under the general theory of virtual processes.},

@misc{Marshall2019,
	abstract = {We have developed the concept of pathway assembly to explore the amount of extrinsic information required to build an object. To quantify this information in an agnostic way, we present a method to determine the amount of pathway assembly information contained within such an object by deconstructing the object into its irreducible parts, and then evaluating the minimum number of steps to reconstruct the object along any pathway. The mathematical formalisation of this approach uses an assembly space. By finding the minimal number of steps contained in the route by which the objects can be assembled within that space, we can compare how much information (I) is gained from knowing this pathway assembly index (PA) according to I\_PA=log ({\textbar}N{\textbar})/({\textbar}N\_PA {\textbar}) where, for an end product with PA=x, N is the set of objects possible that can be created from the same irreducible parts within x steps regardless of PA, and NPA is the subset of those objects with the precise pathway assembly index PA=x. Applying this formalism to objects formed in 1D, 2D and 3D space allows us to identify objects in the world or wider Universe that have high assembly numbers. We propose that objects with PA greater than a threshold are important because these are uniquely identifiable as those that must have been produced by biological or technological processes, rather than the assembly occurring via unbiased random processes alone. We think this approach is needed to help identify the new physical and chemical laws needed to understand what life is, by quantifying what life does.},

The newly proposed Quantum Petri Nets (QPNs) have the structure of the classical Petri Nets (PNs), but their tokens represent superposed quantum states fulfilling the Hilbert space features. Instead of the integer numerical values of the PN marking, QPNs use quantum marking describing an extreme huge space. New conditions for the transition enabling and new mappings for the transition executions are conceived. A PN based language is used for the structure analysis. Replacing the classical tokens with the probability distribution of the quantum vectors, the QPN simulation is possible as well as the construction of a reachability graph.},

	abstract = {The Ripple network is one of the most prominent blockchain platforms and its native XRP token currently has one of the highest cryptocurrency market capitalizations. The Ripple consensus protocol powers this network and is generally considered to a Byzantine fault-tolerant agreement protocol, which can reach consensus in the presence of faulty or malicious nodes. In contrast to traditional Byzantine agreement protocols, there is no global knowledge of all participating nodes in Ripple consensus; instead, each node declares a list of other nodes that it trusts and from which it considers votes. Previous work has brought up concerns about the liveness and safety of the consensus protocol under the general assumptions stated initially by Ripple, and there is currently no appropriate understanding of its workings and its properties in the literature. This paper closes this gap and makes two contributions. It first provides a detailed, abstract description of the protocol, which has been derived from the source code. Second, the paper points out that the abstract protocol may violate safety and liveness in several simple executions under relatively benign network assumptions.},

	abstract = {In this paper I apply newly-proposed information-theoretic principles to thermodynamic work extraction. I show that if it is possible to extract work deterministically from a physical system prepared in any one of a set of states, then those states must be distinguishable from one another. This result is formulated independently of scale and of particular dynamical laws; it also provides a novel connection between thermodynamics and information theory, established via the law of conservation of energy (rather than the second law of thermodynamics). Albeit compatible with these conclusions, existing thermodynamics approaches cannot provide a result of such generality, because they are scale-dependent (relying on ensembles or coarse-graining) or tied to particular dynamical laws. This paper thus provides a broader foundation for thermodynamics, with implications for the theory of von Neumann's universal constructor},

In this letter, we discuss for the first time how irreversibility can emerge within the recently proposed constructor theory framework. Here irreversibility is expressed as the requirement that a task is possible, while its inverse is not. In particular, we demonstrate that this irreversibility is compatible with quantum theory's time reversal symmetric laws, by exploiting a specific model, based on the universal quantum homogeniser, realised experimentally with high-quality single-photon qubits.},

	abstract = {Unitary quantum theory, having no Born Rule, is non-probabilistic. Hence the notorious problem of reconciling it with the unpredictability and appearance of stochasticity in quantum measurements. Generalising and improving upon the so-called 'decision-theoretic approach' (Deutsch, 1999; Wallace, 2003, 2007, 2012), I shall recast that problem in the recently proposed constructor theory of information - where quantum theory is represented as one of a class of superinformation theories, which are local, non-probabilistic theories conforming to certain constructor-theoretic conditions. I prove that the unpredictability of measurement outcomes (to which I give an exact meaning via constructor theory), necessarily arises in superinformation theories. Then I explain how the appearance of stochasticity in (finitely many) repeated measurements can arise under superinformation theories. And I establish sufficient conditions for a superinformation theory to inform decisions (made under it) as if it were probabilistic, via a Deutsch-Wallace-type argument - thus defining a class of decision-supporting superinformation theories. This broadens the domain of applicability of that argument to cover constructor-theory compliant theories. In addition, in this version some of the argument's assumptions, previously construed as merely decision-theoretic, follow from physical properties expressed by constructor-theoretic principles.},

@article{Deutsch2012,
	abstract = {Constructor theory seeks to express all fundamental scientific theories in terms of a dichotomy between possible and impossible physical transformations - those that can be caused to happen and those that cannot. This is a departure from the prevailing conception of fundamental physics which is to predict what will happen from initial conditions and laws of motion. Several converging motivations for expecting constructor theory to be a fundamental branch of physics are discussed. Some principles of the theory are suggested and its potential for solving various problems and achieving various unifications is explored. These include providing a theory of information underlying classical and quantum information; generalising the theory of computation to include all physical transformations; unifying formal statements of conservation laws with the stronger operational ones (such as the ruling-out of perpetual motion machines); expressing the principles of testability and of the computability of nature (currently deemed methodological and metaphysical respectively) as laws of physics; allowing exact statements of emergent laws (such as the second law of thermodynamics); and expressing certain apparently anthropocentric attributes such as knowledge in physical terms.},

@article{Hassanzadeh2010,
	abstract = {The Alternating Step(r,s) Generator, ASG(r,s), is a clock-controlled sequence generator which is recently proposed by A. Kanso. It consists of three registers of length l, m and n bits. The first register controls the clocking of the two others. The two other registers are clocked r times (or not clocked) (resp. s times or not clocked) depending on the clock-control bit in the first register. The special case r=s=1 is the original and well known Alternating Step Generator. Kanso claims there is no efficient attack against the ASG(r,s) since r and s are kept secret. In this paper, we present an Alternating Step Generator, ASG, model for the ASG(r,s) and also we present a new and efficient algebraic attack on ASG(r,s) using 3(m+n) bits of the output sequence to find the secret key with O((m^2+n^2)*2^{l+1}+ (2^{m-1})*m^3 + (2^{n-1})*n^3) computational complexity. We show that this system is no more secure than the original ASG, in contrast to the claim of the ASG(r,s)'s constructor.},

Algebraic Combin. 53(4):1187-1213, 2020] proposes a model of discrete-time quantum walk whose transition matrix is given by two reflections, using the face and vertex incidence relations of a graph embedded in an orientable surface. We show that the evolution of a general discrete-time quantum walk that consists of two reflections satisfies a Chebyshev recurrence, under a projection. For the vertex-face walk, we prove theorems about perfect state transfer and periodicity and give infinite families of examples where these occur. We bring together tools from algebraic and topological graph theory to analyze the evolution of this walk.},

@misc{Klein2015,
	abstract = {I argue that our current practice of ascribing the term `` memory '' to mental states and processes lacks epistemic warrant. Memory, according to the ``received view'', is any state or process that results from the sequential stages of encoding, storage and retrieval. By these criteria, memory, or its footprint, can be seen in virtually every mental state we are capable of having. This, I argue, stretches the term to the breaking point. I draw on phenomenological, historical and conceptual considerations to make the case that an act of memory entails a direct, non-inferential feeling of re-acquaintance with one's past. It does so by linking content retrieved from storage with autonoetic awareness during retrieval. On this view, memory is not the content of experience, but the manner in which that content is experienced. I discuss some theoretical and practical implications and advantages of adopting this more nuanced view of memory.},

Surprisingly, (i) systems separation with (ii) temperature differences and (iii) long thermalization times are sufficient conditions to produce macroscopic traces. Traces of the past are ubiquitous because these conditions are largely satisfied in our universe. I quantify these thermodynamical conditions for memory and derive an expression for the maximum amount of information stored in such memories as a function of the relevant thermodynamical parameters. This mechanism transforms low entropy into available information. I suggest that all macroscopic information has this origin in past low entropy.},

@article{Deutsch1999,
	abstract = {{\S}1. Mathematics and the physical world. Genuine scientific knowledge cannot be certain, nor can it be justified a priori. Instead, it must be conjectured, and then tested by experiment, and this requires it to be expressed in a language appropriate for making precise, empirically testable predictions. That language is mathematics.This in turn constitutes a statement about what the physical world must be like if science, thus conceived, is to be possible. As Galileo put it, ``the universe is written in the language of mathematics''. Galileo's introduction of mathematically formulated, testable theories into physics marked the transition from the Aristotelian conception of physics, resting on supposedly necessary a priori principles, to its modern status as a theoretical, conjectural and empirical science. Instead of seeking an infallible universal mathematical design, Galilean science usesmathematics to express quantitative descriptions of an objective physical reality. Thus mathematics became the language in which we express our knowledge of the physical world --- a language that is not only extraordinarily powerful and precise, but also effective in practice. Eugene Wigner referred to ``the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the physical sciences''. But is this effectiveness really unreasonable or miraculous?Numbers, sets, groups and algebras have an autonomous reality quite independent of what the laws of physics decree, and the properties of these mathematical structures can be just as objective as Plato believed they were (and as Roger Penrose now advocates).},

	abstract = {In the macroscopic world, time is intrinsically asymmetric, flowing in a specific direction, from past to future. However, the same is not necessarily true for quantum systems, as some quantum processes produce valid quantum evolutions under time reversal. Supposing that such processes can be probed in both time directions, we can also consider quantum processes probed in a coherent superposition of forwards and backwards time directions. This yields a broader class of quantum processes than the ones considered so far in the literature, including those with indefinite causal order. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time an operation belonging to this new class: the quantum time flip. Using a photonic realisation of this operation, we apply it to a game formulated as a discrimination task between two sets of operators. This game not only serves as a witness of an indefinite time direction, but also allows for a computational advantage over strategies using a fixed time direction, and even those with an indefinite causal order.},

@misc{Surace2023,
	abstract = {What would be the consequences if there were fundamental limits to our ability to experimentally explore the world? In this work we seriously consider this question. We assume the existence of statements whose truth value is not experimentally accessible. That is, there is no way, not even in theory, to directly test if these statements are true or false. We further develop a theory in which experimentally accessible statements are a union of a fixed minimum number of inaccessible statements. For example, the value of truth of the statements "a" and "b" is not accessible, but the value of truth of the statement "a or b" is accessible. We do not directly assume probability theory, we exclusively define experimentally accessible and inaccessible statements and build on these notions using the rules of classical logic. We find that an interesting structure emerges. Developing this theory, we relax the logical structure to a probabilistic one, obtaining a theory rich in structure that we call "theory of inaccessible information". Surprisingly, the simplest model of theory of inaccessible information is the qubit in quantum mechanics. Along the path for the construction of this theory, we characterise and study a family of multiplicative information measures that we call "inaccessibility measures".},

@article{Baez2018,
	abstract = {Reaction networks are a general formalism for describing collections of classical entities interacting in a random way. While reaction networks are mainly studied by chemists, they are equivalent to Petri nets, which are used for similar purposes in computer science and biology. As noted by Doi and others, techniques from quantum physics, such as second quantization, can be adapted to apply to such systems. Here we use these techniques to study how the ``master equation'' describing stochastic time evolution for a reaction network is related to the ``rate equation'' describing the deterministic evolution of the expected number of particles of each species in the large-number limit. We show that the relation is especially strong when a solution of master equation is a ``coherent state'', meaning that the numbers of entities of each kind are described by independent Poisson distributions. Remarkably, in this case the rate equation and master equation give the exact same formula for the time derivative of the expected number of particles of each species.},

@article{Coecke2012,
	abstract = {There is an incompatibility between the symmetries of causal structure in relativity theory and the signaling abilities of probabilistic devices with inputs and outputs: while time-reversal in relativity will not introduce the ability to signal between spacelike separated regions, this is not the case for probabilistic devices with space-like separated input-output pairs. We explicitly describe a non-signaling device which becomes a perfect signaling device under time-reversal, where time-reversal can be conceptualized as playing backwards a videotape of an agent manipulating the device. This leads to an arrow of time that is identifiable when studying the correlations of events for spacelike separated regions. Somewhat surprisingly, although time-reversal of Popuscu-Roerlich boxes also allows agents to signal, it does not yield a perfect signaling device. Finally, we realize time-reversal using post-selection, which could lead experimental implementation.},

@misc{Gogioso2023,
	abstract = {We introduce and explore the notion of "spaces of input histories", a broad family of combinatorial objects which can be used to model input-dependent, dynamical causal order. We motivate our definition with reference to traditional partial order- and preorder-based notions of causal order, adopted by the majority of previous literature on the subject, and we proceed to explore the novel landscape of combinatorial complexity made available by our generalisation of those notions. In the process, we discover that the fine-grained structure of causality is significantly more complex than we might have previously believed: in the simplest case of binary inputs, the number of available "causally complete" spaces grows from 7 on 2 events, to 2644 on 3 events, to an unknown number on 4 events (likely around a billion). For perspective, previous literature on non-locality and contextuality used a single one of the 2644 available spaces on 3 events, work on definite causality used 19 spaces, derived from partial orders, and work on indefinite causality used only 6 more, for a grand total of 25. This paper is the first instalment in a trilogy: the sheaf-theoretic treatment of causal distributions is detailed in Part 2, "The Topology of Causality" [arXiv:2303.07148], while the polytopes formed by the associated empirical models are studied in Part 3, "The Geometry of Causality" [arXiv:2303.09017]. An exhaustive classification of the 2644 causally complete spaces on 3 events with binary inputs is provided in the supplementary work "Classification of causally complete spaces on 3 events with binary inputs", together with the algorithm used for the classification and partial results from the ongoing search on 4 events.},

	abstract = {Meaning has been left outside most theoretical approaches to information in biology. Functional responses based on an appropriate interpretation of signals have been replaced by a probabilistic description of correlations between emitted and received symbols. This assumption leads to potential paradoxes, such as the presence of a maximum information associated to a channel that creates completely wrong interpretations of the signals. Game-theoretic models of language evolution and other studies considering embodied communicating agents show that the correct (meaningful) match resulting from agent-agent exchanges is always achieved and natural systems obviously solve the problem correctly. Inspired by the concept of duality of the communicative sign stated by the swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, here we present a complete description of the minimal system necessary to measure the amount of information that is consistently decoded. Several consequences of our developments are investigated, such as the uselessness of a certain amount of information properly transmitted for communication among autonomous agents.},

	abstract = {The general concept of information is here, for the first time, defined mathematically by adding one single axiom to the probability theory. This Mathematical Theory of Information is explored in fourteen chapters: 1. Information can be measured in different units, in anything from bits to dollars. We will here argue that any measure is acceptable if it does not violate the Law of Diminishing Information. This law is supported by two independent arguments: one derived from the Bar-Hillel ideal receiver, the other is based on Shannon's noisy channel. The entropy in the 'classical information theory' is one of the measures conforming to the Law of Diminishing Information, but it has, however, properties such as being symmetric, which makes it unsuitable for some applications. The measure reliability is found to be a universal information measure. 2. For discrete and finite signals, the Law of Diminishing Information is defined mathematically, using probability theory and matrix algebra. 3. The Law of Diminishing Information is used as an axiom to derive essential properties of information. Byron's law: there is more information in a lie than in gibberish. Preservation: no information is lost in a reversible channel. Etc. The Mathematical Theory of Information supports colligation, i. e. the property to bind facts together making 'two plus two greater than four'. Colligation is a must when the information carries knowledge, or is a base for decisions. In such cases, reliability is always a useful information measure. Entropy does not allow colligation.},

@misc{Selby2022,
	abstract = {There is a stark tension among different formulations of quantum theory in that some are fundamentally time-symmetric and others are radically time-asymmetric. This tension is crisply captured when thinking of physical theories as theories of processes. We review process theories and their diagrammatic representation, and show how quantum theory can be described in this language. The tension between time-symmetry and time-asymmetry is then captured by the tension between two of the key structures that are used in this framework. On the one hand, the symmetry is captured by a dagger structure, which is represented by a reflection of diagrams. On the other hand, the asymmetry is captured by a condition involving discarding which, ultimately, is responsible for the theory being compatible with relativistic causality. Next we consider three different ways in which we this tension can be resolved. The first of these is closely related to recent work of Lucien Hardy, where the tension is resolved by adding in a time reversed version of discarding together with a suitable consistency condition. The second is, to our knowledge, a new approach. Here the tension is resolved by adding in new systems which propagate backwards in time, and imposing a consistency condition to avoid running into well known time-travel paradoxes. The final approach that we explore is closely related to work of Oreshkov and Cerf, where the tension is resolved by removing the constraint associated with discarding. We show two equivalent ways in which this can be done whilst ensuring that the resulting theory still makes sensible operational predictions.},

@misc{Gao2024,
	abstract = {In multi-source remote sensing image classification field, remarkable progress has been made by convolutional neural network and Transformer. However, existing methods are still limited due to the inherent local reductive bias. Recently, Mamba-based methods built upon the State Space Model have shown great potential for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity, but it has rarely been explored for the multi-source remote sensing image classification task. To this end, we propose Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Mamba (MSFMamba) network for hyperspectral image (HSI) and LiDAR/SAR data joint classification. Specifically, MSFMamba mainly comprises three parts: Multi-Scale Spatial Mamba (MSpa-Mamba) block, Spectral Mamba (Spe-Mamba) block, and Fusion Mamba (Fus-Mamba) block. Specifically, to solve the feature redundancy in multiple canning routes, the MSpa-Mamba block incorporates the multi-scale strategy to minimize the computational redundancy and alleviate the feature redundancy of SSM. In addition, Spe-Mamba is designed for spectral feature exploration, which is essential for HSI feature modeling. Moreover, to alleviate the heterogeneous gap between HSI and LiDAR/SAR data, we design Fus-Mamba block for multi-source feature fusion. The original Mamba is extended to accommodate dual inputs, and cross-modal feature interaction is enhanced. Extensive experimental results on three multi-source remote sensing datasets demonstrate the superiority performance of the proposed MSFMamba over the state-of-the-art models. Source codes of MSFMamba will be made public available at https://github.com/summitgao/MSFMamba .},

@misc{Reinhardt2024,
	abstract = {Space-based gravitational-wave detectors, such as LISA, record interferometric measurements on widely separated satellites. Their clocks are not synced actively. Instead, clock synchronization is performed in on-ground data processing. It relies on measurements of the so-called pseudoranges, which entangle the interspacecraft light travel times with the clock desynchronizations between emitting and receiving spacecraft. For interspacecraft clock synchronization, we need to isolate the differential clock desynchronizations, i.e., disentangle the pseudoranges. This further yields estimates for the interspacecraft light travel times, which are required as delays for the laser frequency noise suppression via time-delay interferometry. Previous studies on pseudorange disentanglement apply various simplifications in the pseudorange modeling and the data simulation. In contrast, this article derives an accurate pseudorange model in the barycentric celestial reference system, complemented by realistic state-of-the-art LISA data simulations. Concerning pseudorange disentanglement, this leads to an a priori under-determined system. We demonstrate how on-ground orbit determinations, as well as onboard transmission and on-ground reception time tags of the telemetry data, can be used to resolve this degeneracy. We introduce an algorithm for pseudorange disentanglement based on a nonstandard Kalman filter specially designed for clock synchronization in systems where pseudorange measurements are conducted in different time frames. This algorithm achieves interspacecraft clock synchronization and light travel time estimation with submeter accuracy, thus fulfilling the requirements of time-delay interferometry.},

Specifically, we consider a simple quantum network and construct a self-testing procedure. This result also demonstrates that genuine network quantum nonlocality can be obtained using only non-entangled measurements. From a more general perspective, our work establishes a connection between the effect of nonlocality without entanglement and the area of Bell nonlocality.},

@article{Lee2023a,
	abstract = {Tiered distributed computing systems, where components run in Internet-of-things devices, in edge computers, and in the cloud, introduce unique difficulties in maintaining consistency of shared data while ensuring availability. A major source of difficulty is the highly variable network latencies that applications must deal with. It is well known in distributed computing that when network latencies rise sufficiently, one or both of consistency and availability must be sacrificed. This paper quantifies consistency and availability and gives an algebraic relationship between these quantities and network latencies. The algebraic relation is linear in a max-plus algebra and supports heterogeneous networks, where the communication latency between 2 components may differ from the latency between another 2 components. We show how to make use this algebraic relation to guide design, enabling software designers to specify consistency and availability requirements, and to derive from those the requirements on network latencies. We show how to design systems to fail in predictable ways when the network latency requirements are violated, by choosing to sacrifice either consistency or availability.},

	abstract = {We describe metastable failures---a failure pattern in distributed systems. Currently, metastable failures manifest themselves as black swan events; they are outliers because nothing in the past points to their possibility, have a severe impact, and are much easier to explain in hindsight than to predict. Although instances of metastable failures can look different at the surface, deeper analysis shows that they can be understood within the same framework. We introduce a framework for thinking about metastable failures, apply it to examples observed during years of operating distributed systems at scale, and survey ad-hoc techniques developed post-factum for making systems resilient to known metastable failures. A systematic approach for building systems that are robust against unknown meta-stable failures remains an open problem.},

	abstract = {Complex software systems often feature distinct modes of operation, each designed to handle a particular scenario that may require the system to respond in a certain way. Breaking down system behavior into mutually exclusive modes and discrete transitions between modes is a commonly used strategy to reduce implementation complexity and promote code readability. However, such capabilities often come in the form of self-contained domain specific languages or language-specific frameworks. The work in this paper aims to bring the advantages of modal models to mainstream programming languages, by following the polyglot coordination approach of Lingua Franca (LF), in which verbatim target code (e.g., C, C++, Python, Typescript, or Rust) is encapsulated in composable reactive components called reactors. Reactors can form a dataflow network, are triggered by timed as well as sporadic events, execute concurrently, and can be distributed across nodes on a network. With modal models in LF, we introduce a lean extension to the concept of reactors that enables the coordination of reactive tasks based on modes of operation. The implementation of modal reactors outlined in this paper generalizes to any LF-supported language with only modest modifications to the generic runtime system.},

@inproceedings{Merrifield2019,
	abstract = {Deterministic multithreading (DMT) fundamentally requires total, deterministic ordering of synchronization operations on each synchronization variable, i.e. a partial ordering over all synchronization operations. In practice, prior DMT systems totally order all synchronization operations, regardless of synchronization variable; the result is severe performance degradation for highly concurrent applications using fine-grained synchronization. Motivated by this class of programs, we propose lazy determinism as a way to go beyond this total order bottleneck. Lazy determinism executes synchronization operations speculatively, and enforces determinism by subsequently validating the resulting order of operations. If an ordering violation is detected, part of the computation is restarted. By enforcing only the partial ordering required to guarantee determinism, lazy determinism increases the available parallelism during deterministic execution. We implement LazyDet via a pure-software runtime system accelerated by custom Linux kernel support. Our experiments with hash table benchmarks from Synchrobench show roughly an order of magnitude improvement in the performance of lock-based data structures compared to the state of the art in eager determinism. For benchmarks from PARSEC-2, SPLASH-2, and Phoenix, we demonstrate runtime improvements of up to 2× on the programs that challenge deterministic execution environments the most.},

	abstract = {This article aims to provide a novel formalization of the concept of computational irreducibility in terms of the exactness of functorial correspondence between a category of data structures and elementary computations and a corresponding category of (1-dimensional) cobordisms. We proceed to demonstrate that, by equipping both categories with a symmetric monoidal structure and considering the case of higher-dimensional cobordism categories, we obtain a natural extension of this formalism that serves also to encompass non-deterministic or ``multiway'' computations, in which one quantifies not only the irreducibility in the behavior of a single (deterministic) computation path, but in the branching and merging behavior of an entire ``multiway system'' of such paths too. We finally outline how, in the most general case, the resulting symmetric monoidal functor may be considered to be adjoint to the functor characterizing the Atiyah-Segal axiomatization of a functorial quantum field theory. Thus, we conclude by arguing that the irreducibility of (multi)computations may be thought of as being dual to the locality of time evolution in functorial approaches to quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. In the process, we propose an extension of the methods of standard (monoidal) category theory, in which morphisms are effectively equipped with intrinsic computational complexity data, together with an algebra for how those complexities compose (both in sequence and in parallel, subject to the monoidal structure).},

	abstract = {All chapters have dealt up to now with lossless systems. This chapter shows that network calculus can also be applied to lossy systems, if we model them as a lossless system preceded by a `clipper' [15, 16], which is a controller dropping some data when a buffer is full, or when a delay constraint would otherwise be violated. By applying once again Theorem 4.3.1, we obtain a representation formula for losses. We use this formula to compute various bounds. The first one is a bound on the loss rate in an element when both an arrival curve of the incoming traffic and a minimum service curve of the element are known.We use it next to bound losses in a complex with a complex service curve (e.g., VBR shapers) by means of losses with simpler service curves (e.g., CBR shapers). Finally, we extend the clipper, which models data drops due to buffer overflow, to a `compensator', which models data accrual to prevent buffer underflow, and use it to compute explicit solutions to Skorokhod reflection mapping problem with two boundaries.},

	abstract = {Homa is a new transport protocol for datacenter networks. It provides exceptionally low latency, especially for workloads with a high volume of very short messages, and it also supports large messages and high network utilization. Homa uses in-network priority queues to ensure low latency for short messages; priority allocation is managed dynamically by each receiver and integrated with a receiver-driven flow control mechanism. Homa also uses controlled overcommitment of receiver downlinks to ensure efficient bandwidth utilization at high load. Our implementation of Homa delivers 99th percentile round-trip times less than 15 μs for short messages on a 10 Gbps network running at 80\% load. These latencies are almost 100x lower than the best published measurements of an implementation. In simulations, Homa's latency is roughly equal to pFabric and significantly better than pHost, PIAS, and NDP for almost all message sizes and workloads. Homa can also sustain higher network loads than pFabric, pHost, or PIAS.},

In a cluster benchmark with 40 nodes, Homa/Linux provided lower latency than both TCP and DCTCP for all message sizes; for short messages, Homa's 99th percentile tail latency was 7--83x lower than TCP and DCTCP. The benchmarks also show that Homa has eliminated network congestion as a significant performance limitation. Both tail latency and throughput are now limited by software overheads, particularly software congestion caused by imperfect load balancing of the protocol stack across cores. Another factor of 5--10x in performance can be achieved if software overheads can be eliminated in the future.},

Every significant element of TCP, from its stream orientation to its expectation of in-order packet delivery, is wrong for the datacenter. It is time to recognize that TCP's problems are too fundamental and interrelated to be fixed; the only way to harness the full performance potential of modern networks is to introduce a new transport protocol into the datacenter. Homa demonstrates that it is possible to create a transport protocol that avoids all of TCP's problems. Although Homa is not API-compatible with TCP, it should be possible to bring it into widespread usage by integrating it with RPC frameworks.},

This link helps to clarify how we can learn about the symmetries of our world; how to understand the relationship between symmetries and what is real, and how to overcome pervasive illusions about the direction of time. Roberts explains the significance of time reversal in a way that intertwines physics and philosophy, to establish what the arrow of time means and how we can come to know it.

Since finding an optimal schedule is an NP-complete problem in general, researchers have resorted to devising efficient heuristics. A plethora of heuristics have been proposed based on a wide spectrum of techniques, including branch-and-bound, integer-programming, searching, graph-theory, randomization, genetic algorithms, and evolutionary methods. The objective of this survey is to describe various scheduling algorithms and their functionalities in a contrasting fashion as well as examine their relative merits in terms of performance and time-complexity. Since these algorithms are based on diverse assumptions, they differ in their functionalities, and hence are difficult to describe in a unified context. We propose a taxonomy that classifies these algorithms into different categories. We consider 27 scheduling algorithms, with each algorithm explained through an easy-to-understand description followed by an illustrative example to demonstrate its operation. We also outline some of the novel and promising optimization approaches and current research trends in the area. Finally, we give an overview of the software tools that provide scheduling/mapping functionalities.},

Nodes can be scheduled statically (at compile time) onto single or parallel programmable processors so the run-time overhead usually associated with data flow evaporates. Multiple sample rates within the same system are easily and naturally handled. Conditions for correctness of SDF graph are explained and scheduling algorithms are described for homogeneous parallel processors sharing memory.

Though progress is being made, the lack of theoretical predictions and experiments in quantum gravity makes it difficult to use empirical evidence to justify a theory of causality at quantum level in normal circumstances, i. e. by predicting the value of a well-confirmed experimental result. For a variety of reasons, the problem of the deterministic relationship between cause and effect is related to basic problems of physics as such. Despite the common belief, it is a remarkable fact that a theory of causality should be consistent with a theory of everything and is because of this linked to problems of a theory of everything. Thus far, solving the problem of causality will help us to solve the problems of the theory of everything (at quantum level).},

@misc{BenZvi2011,
	abstract = {Effecting coordination across remote sites in a distributed system is an essential part of distributed computing, and also an inherent challenge. In 1978, an analysis of communication in asynchronous systems was suggested by Leslie Lamport. Lamport's analysis determines a notion of temporal precedence, a sort of weak notion of time, which is otherwise missing in asynchronous systems. This notion has been extensively utilized in various applications. Yet the analysis is limited to systems that are asynchronous. In this thesis we go beyond by investigating causality in synchronous systems. In such systems, the boundaries of causal influence are not charted out exclusively by message passing. Here time itself, passing at a uniform (or almost uniform) rate for all processes, is also a medium by which causal influence may fan out. This thesis studies, and characterizes, the combinations of time and message passing that govern causal influence in synchronous systems. It turns out that knowledge based analysis [FHMV] provides a well tailored formal framework within which causal notions can be studied. As we show, the formal notion of knowledge is highly appropriate for characterizing causal influence in terms of information flow, broadening the analysis of Chandy and Misra in [ChM]. We define several generic classes of coordination problems that pose various temporal ordering requirements on the participating processes. These coordination problems provide natural generalizations of real life requirements. We then analyze the causal conditions that underlie suitable solutions to these problems. The analysis is conducted in two stages: first, the temporal ordering requirements are reduced to epistemic conditions. Then, these epistemic conditions are characterized in terms of the causal communication patterns that are necessary and sufficient to bring them about.},

This puts the unique status of mathematics as exact science into peril. Now may be the time to reconcile theory and practice, i.e. precision and intuition, through the advent of computer proof assistants. For the most time this has been a topic for experts in specialized communities. However, mathematical proofs have become increasingly sophisticated, stretching the boundaries of what is humanly comprehensible, so that leading mathematicians have asked for formal verification of their proofs. At the same time, major theorems in mathematics have recently been computer-verified by people from outside of these communities, even by beginning students. This article investigates the gap between the different definitions of a proof and possibilities to build bridges. It is written as a polemic or a collage by different members of the communities in mathematics and computer science at different stages of their careers, challenging well-known preconceptions and exploring new perspectives.},

@misc{Wu2024,
	abstract = {The concept of distributed consensus gained widespread attention following the publication of "Byzantine Generals Problem" by Leslie Lamport in the 1980s. This research topic has been active and extensively studied over the last four decades, particularly since the advent of blockchain technology in 2009. Blockchain technology employs Proof-of-X (PoX) or Byzantine-fault-tolerant (BFT) systems, where all participants follow a protocol to achieve a common state (i.e., consistency) eventually. However, because PoX consensus such as Proof-of-Work is is resource-intensive with high power consumption, most permissioned blockchains employ BFT to achieve consistency. In this article, we provide an introduction to the fundamental principles and history of distributed consensus. We then explore the well-known fault-tolerant state machine replication (SMR) in partially synchronous networks, as well as consensus protocols in asynchronous models and recently proposed DAG-based consensus. Additionally, we examine the relationship between BFT consensus and blockchain technology and discuss the following questions: What is the history and evolution of BFT? Why are BFT protocols designed in the way they are and what core components do they use? What is the connection between BFT and blockchain technology, and what are the driving needs for future BFT research?},

Many problems in distributed systems can be cast in terms of the problem of detecting global states. For instance, the global state detection algorithm helps to solve an important class of problems: stable property detection. A stable property is one that persists: once a stable property becomes true it remains true thereafter. Examples of stable properties are ``computation has terminated,'' `` the system is deadlocked'' and ``all tokens in a token ring have disappeared.'' The stable property detection problem is that of devising algorithms to detect a given stable property. Global state detection can also be used for checkpointing.},

@article{Lamport1989,
	abstract = {Over the past few years, I have developed an approach to the formal specification of concurrent systems that I now call the transition axiom method. The basic formalism has already been described in [12] and [1], but the formal details tend to obscure the important concepts. Here, I attempt to explain these concepts without discussing the details of the underlying formalism.Concurrent systems are not easy to specify. Even a simple system can be subtle, and it is often hard to find the appropriate abstractions that make it understandable. Specifying a complex system is a formidable engineering task. We can understand complex structures only if they are composed of simple parts, so a method for specifying complex systems must have a simple conceptual basis. I will try to demonstrate that the transition axiom method provides such a basis. However, I will not address the engineering problems associated with specifying real systems. Instead, the concepts will be illustrated with a series of toy examples that are not meant to be taken seriously as real specifications.Are you proposing a specification language? No. The transition axiom method provides a conceptual and logical foundation for writing formal specifications; it is not a specification language. The method determines what a specification must say; a language determines in detail how it is said.What do you mean by a formal specification? I find it helpful to view a specification as a contract between the user of a system and its implementer. The contract should tell the user everything he must know to use the system, and it should tell the implementer everything he must know about the system to implement it. In principle, once this contract has been agreed upon, the user and the implementer have no need for further communication. (This view describes the function of the specification; it is not meant as a paradigm for how systems should be built.)For a specification to be formal, the question of whether an implementation satisfies the specification must be reducible to the question of whether an assertion is provable in some mathematical system. To demonstrate that he has met the terms of the contract, the implementer should resort to logic rather than contract law. This does not mean that an implementation must be accompanied by a mathematical proof. It does mean that it should be possible, in principle though not necessarily in practice, to provide such a proof for a correct implementation. The existence of a formal basis for the specification method is the only way I know to guarantee that specifications are unambiguous.Ultimately, the systems we specify are physical objects, and mathematics cannot prove physical properties. We can prove properties only of a mathematical model of the system; whether or not the system correctly implements the model must remain a question of law and not of mathematics.Just what is a system? By "system," I mean anything that interacts with its environment in a discrete (digital) fashion across a well-defined boundary. An airline reservation system is such a system, where the boundary might be drawn between the agents using the system, who are part of the environment, and the terminals, which are part of the system. A Pascal procedure is a system whose environment is the rest of the program, with which it interacts by responding to procedure calls and accessing global variables. Thus, the system being specified may be just one component of a larger system.A real system has many properties, ranging from its response time to the color of the cabinet. No formal method can specify all of these properties. Which ones can be specified with the transition axiom method? The transition axiom method specifies the behavior of a System---that is, the sequence of observable actions it performs when interacting with the environment. More precisely, it specifies two classes of behavioral properties: safety and liveness properties. Safety properties assert what the system is allowed to do, or equivalently, what it may not do. Partial correctness is an example of a safety property, asserting that a program may not generate an incorrect answer. Liveness properties assert what the system must do. Termination is an example of a liveness property, asserting that a program must eventually generate an answer. (Alpern and Schneider [2] have formally defined these two classes of properties.) In the transition axiom method, safety and liveness properties are specified separately.There are important behavioral properties that cannot be specified by the transition axiom method; these include average response time and probability of failure. A transition axiom specification can provide a formal model with which to analyze such properties,1 but it cannot formally specify them.There are also important nonbehavioral properties of systems that one might want to specify, such as storage requirements and the color of the cabinet. These lie completely outside the realm of the method.Why specify safety and liveness properties separately? There is a single formalism that underlies a transition axiom specification, so there is no formal separation between the specification of safety and liveness properties. However, experience indicates that different methods are used to reason about the two kinds of properties and it is convenient in practice to separate them. I consider the ability to decompose a specification into liveness and safety properties to be one of the advantages of the method. (One must prove safety properties in order to verify liveness properties, but this is a process of decomposing the proof into smaller lemmas.)Can the method specify real-time behavior? Worst-case behavior can be specified, since the requirement that the system must respond within a certain length of time can be expressed as a safety property---namely, that the clock is not allowed to reach a certain value without the system having responded. Average response time cannot be expressed as a safety or liveness property.The transition axiom method can assert that some action either must occur (liveness) or must not occur (safety). Can it also assert that it is possible for the action to occur? No. A specification serves as a contractual constraint on the behavior of the system. An assertion that the system may or may not do something provides no constraint and therefore serves no function as part of the formal specification. Specification methods that include such assertions generally use them as poor substitutes for liveness properties. Some methods cannot specify that a certain input must result in a certain response, specifying instead that it is possible for the input to be followed by the response. Every specification I have encountered that used such assertions was improved by replacing the possibility assertions with liveness properties that more accurately expressed the system's informal requirements.Imprecise wording can make it appear that a specification contains a possibility assertion when it really doesn't. For example, one sometimes states that it must be possible for a transmission line to lose messages. However, the specification does not require that the loss of messages be possible, since this would prohibit an implementation that guaranteed no messages were lost. The specification might require that something happens (a liveness property) or doesn't happen (a safety property) despite the loss of messages. Or, the statement that messages may be lost might simply be a comment about the specification, observing that it does not require that all messages be delivered, and not part of the actual specification.If a safety property asserts that some action cannot happen, doesn't its negation assert that the action is possible? In a formal system, one must distinguish the logical formula A from the assertion ⊢ A, which means that A is provable in the logic; ⊢ A is not a formula of the logic itself. In the logic underlying the transition axiom method, if A represents a safety property asserting that some action is impossible, then the negation of A, which is the formula ┐A, asserts that the action must occur. The action's possibility is expressed by the negation of ⊢ A, which is a metaformula and not a formula within the logic. See [10] for more details.},

Each nonfaulty processor has a private value of information that must be communicated to each other nonfaulty processor. Nonfaulty processors always communicate honestly, whereas faulty processors may lie. The problem is to devise an algorithm in which processors communicate their own values and relay values received from others that allows each nonfaulty processor to infer a value for each other processor. The value inferred for a nonfaulty processor must be that processor's private value, and the value inferred for a faulty one must be consistent with the corresponding value inferred by each other nonfaulty processor.It is shown that the problem is solvable for, and only for, n ≥ 3m + 1, where m is the number of faulty processors and n is the total number. It is also shown that if faulty processors can refuse to pass on information but cannot falsely relay information, the problem is solvable for arbitrary n ≥ m ≥ 0. This weaker assumption can be approximated in practice using cryptographic methods.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence commonly refers to the science and engineering of artificial systems that can carry out tasks generally associated with requiring aspects of human intelligence, such as playing games, translating languages, and driving cars. In recent years, there have been exciting advances in learning-based, data-driven approaches towards AI, and machine learning and deep learning have enabled computer systems to perceive the world in unprecedented ways. Reinforcement learning has enabled breakthroughs in complex games such as Go and challenging robotics tasks such as quadrupedal locomotion. A key aspect of intelligence is to not only make predictions, but reason about the uncertainty in these predictions, and to consider this uncertainty when making decisions. This is what this manuscript on "Probabilistic Artificial Intelligence" is about. The first part covers probabilistic approaches to machine learning. We discuss the differentiation between "epistemic" uncertainty due to lack of data and "aleatoric" uncertainty, which is irreducible and stems, e.g., from noisy observations and outcomes. We discuss concrete approaches towards probabilistic inference and modern approaches to efficient approximate inference. The second part of the manuscript is about taking uncertainty into account in sequential decision tasks. We consider active learning and Bayesian optimization -- approaches that collect data by proposing experiments that are informative for reducing the epistemic uncertainty. We then consider reinforcement learning and modern deep RL approaches that use neural network function approximation. We close by discussing modern approaches in model-based RL, which harness epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty to guide exploration, while also reasoning about safety.},

	abstract = {The celebrated Asynchronous Computability Theorem of Herlihy and Shavit (JACM 1999) provided a topological characterization of the tasks that are wait-free solvable by processes communicating through writing and reading shared registers. This characterization assumes the use of full-information protocols, in which each time a process writes in the shared memory, it communicates everything it learned since the beginning of the execution. Thus, each register in the shared memory is of unbounded size. Whether unbounded size registers are unavoidable for the model of computation to be universal is the central question studied in this paper. More generally, when at most t out of n processes can crash, is the model with bounded size registers universal?We show that when 1 ≤ t \&lt; n/2 registers of size O(t) bits are sufficient to solve any task that is solvable by a full-information protocol. The situation is radically different when n/2 \&lt; t \&lt; n, which includes the wait-free case. We show that bounded registers are not universal. Specifically, we show that, for any bound f: ℕ → ℕ, and for any n \&gt; 2, there exists a task that cannot be solved by n processes communicating via registers of size f(n) bits, but is solvable by n processes using unbounded registers. The case n = 2, t = 1, where 1-resilient computing and wait-free computing coincide, does not display the same behavior. We show that any task solvable by 2 processes in the wait-free shared-memory model with unbounded-size registers can be solved by 2 processes in the wait-free shared-memory model with constant size registers.Finally, we consider the iterated shared memory model, which has played a crucial role since Herlihy and Shavit's characterization. We show that 1-bit registers (per iteration) are sufficient for solving wait-free any task that is solvable by a full-information wait-free protocol. Therefore, while the wait-free read/write shared-memory model is known to be computationally equivalent to the iterated model, this equivalence only holds if registers are unbounded.},

	abstract = {Effective congestion control in a multi-tenant data center is becoming increasingly challenging with rapidly increasing workload demand, ever faster links, small average transfer sizes, extremely bursty traffic, limited switch buffer capacity, and one-way protocols such as RDMA. Existing deployed algorithms, such as DCQCN, are still far from optimal in many plausible scenarios, particularly for tail latency. Many operators compensate by running their networks at low average utilization, dramatically increasing costs.In this paper, we argue that we have reached the practical limits of end-to-end congestion control. Instead, we propose a new clean slate design based on hop-by-hop per-flow flow control. We show that our approach achieves near optimal tail latency behavior even under challenging conditions such as high average link utilization and in-cast cross traffic. By contrast with prior hop-by-hop schemes, our main innovation is to show that per-flow flow control can be achieved with limited metadata and packet buffering. Further, we show that our approach generalizes well to cross-data center communication.},

We complement their conventional synchronous treatment by showing how to naturally also accommodate asynchrony within them, namely, by decoupling the execution of operation calls into signalling that an operation's implementation needs to be executed, and interrupting a running computation with the operation's result, to which the computation can react by installing interrupt handlers. We formalise these ideas in a small core calculus, called λ{\ae}. We demonstrate the flexibility of λ{\ae}\&nbsp;using examples ranging from a multi-party web application, to preemptive multi-threading, to remote function calls, to a parallel variant of runners of algebraic effects.

Yet -- to fully unveil the potential of quantum computing out of the labs into the business reality -- the challenge ahead is to substantially scale the qubit number, reaching orders of magnitude exceeding thousands of fault-tolerant qubits. To this aim, the distributed quantum computing paradigm is recognized as the key solution for scaling the number of qubits. Indeed, accordingly to such a paradigm, multiple small-to-moderate-scale quantum processors communicate and cooperate for executing computational tasks exceeding the computational power of single processing devices. The aim of this survey is to provide the reader with an overview about the main challenges and open problems arising with distributed quantum computing from a computer and communications engineering perspective. Furthermore, this survey provides an easy access and guide towards the relevant literature and the prominent results in the field.},

The topology of any such circuit restricts which variables may be physically coupled during the operation of a circuit. We investigate how such restrictions on the physical coupling affects the thermodynamic costs of running the circuit. To do this we first calculate the minimal additional entropy production that arises when we run a given gate in a circuit. We then build on this calculation, to analyze how the thermodynamic costs of implementing a computation with a full circuit, comprising multiple connected gates, depends on the topology of that circuit. This analysis provides a rich new set of optimization problems that must be addressed by any designer of a circuit, if they wish to minimize thermodynamic costs.},

Specifically, they want the sophisticated ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability) protection modern databases provide. However, the ACID properties are far from trivial to provide, particularly when high performance must be achieved. This leads to complex and error-prone code--even at a low defect rate of one bug per thousand lines, the millions of lines of code in a commercial OLTP database can harbor thousands of bugs. Here we propose a method to expose and diagnose violations of the ACID properties. We focus on an ostensibly easy case: power faults. Our framework includes workloads to exercise the ACID guarantees, a record/replay subsystem to allow the controlled injection of simulated power faults, a ranking algorithm to prioritize where to fault based on our experience, and a multi-layer tracer to diagnose root causes. Using our framework, we study 8 widely-used databases, ranging from open-source key-value stores to high-end commercial OLTP servers. Surprisingly, all 8 databases exhibit erroneous behavior. For the open-source databases, we are able to diagnose the root causes using our tracer, and for the proprietary commercial databases we can reproducibly induce data loss.},

	abstract = {Many programming languages and programming frameworks focus on parallel and distributed computing. Several frameworks are based on actors, which provide a more disciplined model for concurrency than threads. The interactions between actors, however, if not constrained, admit nondeterminism. As a consequence, actor programs may exhibit unintended behaviors and are less amenable to rigorous testing. We show that nondeterminism can be handled in a number of ways, surveying dataflow dialects, process networks, synchronous-reactive models, and discrete-event models. These existing approaches, however, tend to require centralized control, pose challenges to modular system design, or introduce a single point of failure. We describe ``reactors,'' a new coordination model that combines ideas from several of these approaches to enable determinism while preserving much of the style of actors. Reactors promote modularity and allow for distributed execution. By using a logical model of time that can be associated with physical time, reactors also provide control over timing. Reactors also expose parallelism that can be exploited on multicore machines and in distributed configurations without compromising determinacy.},

So far, causal message delivery has been implemented by augmenting messages with meta data information that allows the receiver (or the platform) to re-order, and if necessary hold back, messages upon receipt before processing. We propose that causal message delivery can be achieved by construction, simply by organizing the nodes of the distributed application into a tree topology, and without the need for any meta data in the messages. We present our ideas informally through an example application and then develop a formal model and prove that causal message delivery is preserved in tree-based networks.},

The key ingredient is the familiar statistical phenomenon of collider bias, or Berkson's bias. In the language of causal models, a collider is a variable causally influenced by two or more other variables. Conditioning on a collider typically produces non-causal associations between its contributing causes, even if they are actually independent.

It is also straightforward that such collider artefacts may become real connections, resembling causality, if a collider is 'constrained' (e.g., by a future boundary condition). We consider the time-reversed analogues of these points in the context of retrocausal models of QM. Retrocausality yields a collider at the source of an EPR-Bell particle pair, and in this case constraint of the collider is possible by normal methods of experimental preparation. It follows that connections resembling causality may be expected to emerge across such colliders, from one branch of the experiment to the other.

@misc{futuresandpromises_2025,
	abstract = {In computer science, futures, promises, delays, and deferreds are constructs used for synchronizing program execution in some concurrent programming languages. Each is an object that acts as a proxy for a result that is initially unknown, usually because the computation of its value is not yet complete.
The term promise was proposed in 1976 by Daniel P. Friedman and David Wise,
and Peter Hibbard called it eventual.
A somewhat similar concept future was introduced in 1977 in a paper by Henry Baker and Carl Hewitt.
The terms future, promise, delay, and deferred are often used interchangeably, although some differences in usage between future and promise are treated below. Specifically, when usage is distinguished, a future is a read-only placeholder view of a variable, while a promise is a writable, single assignment container which sets the value of the future. Notably, a future may be defined without specifying which specific promise will set its value, and different possible promises may set the value of a given future, though this can be done only once for a given future. In other cases a future and a promise are created together and associated with each other: the future is the value, the promise is the function that sets the value -- essentially the return value (future) of an asynchronous function (promise). Setting the value of a future is also called resolving, fulfilling, or binding it.},

	abstract = {Promise theory is a method of analysis suitable for studying any system of interacting components. In the context of information science, promise theory offers a methodology for organising and understanding systems by modelling voluntary cooperation between individual actors or agents, which make public their intentions to one another in the form of promises. Promise theory is grounded in graph theory and set theory.
The goal of promise theory is to reveal the behavior of a whole by taking the viewpoint of the parts rather than the whole. In other words, it is a bottom-up, constructionist view of the world. Promise theory is not a technology or design methodology. It doesn't advocate any position or design principle, except as a method of analysis.
Promise theory is being used in a variety of disciplines ranging from network (SDN) and computer systems management to organizations and finance.},

@misc{plesiochronous_2022,
	abstract = {In telecommunications, a plesiochronous system is one where different parts of the system are almost, but not quite, perfectly synchronised. According to ITU-T standards, a pair of signals are plesiochronous if their significant instants occur at nominally the same rate, with any variation in rate being constrained within specified limits. A sender and receiver operate plesiosynchronously if they operate at the same nominal clock frequency but may have a slight clock frequency mismatch, which leads to a drifting phase. The mismatch between the two systems' clocks is known as the plesiochronous difference.
In general, plesiochronous systems behave similarly to synchronous systems, except they must employ some means in order to cope with "sync slips", which will happen at intervals due to the plesiochronous nature of the system. The most common example of a plesiochronous system design is the plesiochronous digital hierarchy networking standard.
The asynchronous serial communication protocol is asynchronous on the byte level, but plesiochronous on the bit level. The receiver detects the start of a byte by detecting a transition that may occur at a random time after the preceding byte. The indefinite wait and lack of external synchronization signals makes byte detection asynchronous. Then the receiver samples at predefined intervals to determine the values of the bits in the byte; this is plesiochronous since it depends on the transmitter to transmit at roughly the same rate the receiver expects, without coordination of the rate while the bits are being transmitted.
The modern tendency in systems engineering is towards using systems that are either fundamentally asynchronous (such as Ethernet), or fundamentally synchronous (such as synchronous optical networking), and layering these where necessary, rather than using a mixture between the two in a single technology.
The term plesiochronous comes from the Greek πλησίος plesios ("near") and χρόνος chr{\'o}nos ("time").},

In this paper, we revisit these assumptions and demonstrate that communication overhead is now the dominant factor affecting OLTP performance. Using comprehensive whole-stack benchmarks on modern hardware, we analyze both stored procedure and client-side transaction models, revealing that messaging costs play a critical role in end-to-end performance. Additionally, we explore user-defined code isolation, an often-overlooked aspect that poses security risks, especially in multi-tenant database systems. We find that increased isolation can lead to higher communication costs, highlighting the need for new strategies to mitigate these overheads.},

Emil Leon Post is credited with first introducing additional logical truth degrees in his 1921 theory of elementary propositions. The conceptual form and basic ideas of three-valued logic were initially published by Jan {\L}ukasiewicz and Clarence Irving Lewis.

@article{CharronBost2013,
	abstract = {Full Reversal and Partial Reversal are two well-known routing algorithms that were introduced by Gafni and Bertsekas [IEEE Trans. Commun., 29 (1981), pp. 11--18]. By reversing the directions of some links of the graph, these algorithms transform a connected input DAG (directed acyclic graph) into an output DAG in which each node has at least one path to a distinguished destination node. We present a generalization of these algorithms, called the link reversal (LR) algorithm, based on a novel formalization that assigns binary labels to the links of the input DAG. We characterize the legal link labelings for which LR is guaranteed to establish routes. Moreover, we give an exact expression for the number of steps --- called work complexity --- taken by each node in every execution of LR from any legal input graph. Exact expressions for the per-node work complexity of Full Reversal and Partial Reversal follow from our general formula; this is the first exact expression known for Partial Reversal. Our binary link labels formalism facilitates comparison of the work complexity of certain link labelings --- including those corresponding to Full Reversal and Partial Reversal --- using game theory. We consider labelings in which all incoming links of a given node i are labeled with the same binary value μi. Finding initial labelings that induce good work complexity can be considered as a game in which to each node i a player is associated who has strategy μi. In this game, one tries to minimize the cost, i.e., the number of steps. Modeling the initial labelings as this game allows us to compare the work complexity of Full Reversal and Partial Reversal in a way that provides a rigorous basis for the intuition that Partial Reversal is better than Full Reversal with respect to work complexity.},

@inproceedings{Liu2021,
	abstract = {Data races are among the worst bugs in software in that they exhibit non-deterministic symptoms and are notoriously difficult to detect. The problem is exacerbated by interactions between threads and events in real-world applications. We present a novel static analysis technique, O2, to detect data races in large complex multithreaded and event-driven software. O2 is powered by ``origins'', an abstraction that unifies threads and events by treating them as entry points of code paths attributed with data pointers. Origins in most cases are inferred automatically, but can also be specified by developers. More importantly, origins provide an efficient way to precisely reason about shared memory and pointer aliases. Together with several important design choices for race detection, we have implemented O2 for both C/C++ and Java/Android applications and applied it to a wide range of open-source software. O2 has found new races in every single real-world code base we evaluated with, including Linux kernel, Redis, OVS, Memcached, Hadoop, Tomcat, ZooKeeper and Firefox Android. Moreover, O2 scales to millions of lines of code in a few minutes, on average 70x faster (up to 568x) compared to an existing static analysis tool from our prior work, and reduces false positives by 77\%. We also compared O2 with the state-of-the-art static race detection tool, RacerD, showing highly promising results. At the time of writing, O2 has revealed more than 40 unique previously unknown races that have been confirmed or fixed by developers.},

The simplest example of such a transformation is the classical switch of black boxes, where two input black boxes are arranged in two different orders conditionally on the value of a classical bit. The quantum version of this transformation-the quantum switch-produces an output circuit where the order of the connections is controlled by a quantum bit, which becomes entangled with the circuit structure. Simulating these transformations in a circuit with fixed causal structure requires either postselection, or an extra query to the input black boxes.},

  abstract      = {Investigating the role of causal order in quantum mechanics has recently revealed that the causal distribution of events may not be a-priori well-defined in quantum theory. While this has triggered a growing interest on the theoretical side, creating processes without a causal order is an experimental task. Here we report the first decisive demonstration of a process with an indefinite causal order. To do this, we quantify how incompatible our set-up is with a definite causal order by measuring a 'causal witness'. This mathematical object incorporates a series of measurements which are designed to yield a certain outcome only if the process under examination is not consistent with any well-defined causal order. In our experiment we perform a measurement in a superposition of causal orders - without destroying the coherence - to acquire information both inside and outside of a 'causally non-ordered process'. Using this information, we experimentally determine a causal witness, demonstrating by almost seven standard deviations that the experimentally implemented process does not have a definite causal order.},

The way we create robust solutions is under pressure as the individual components don't fail fast but instead, starts running slow, which is far worse The slow component may be healthy enough to say, "I'm still here!" but slow enough to clog up all the work. This makes fail-fast schemes vulnerable.},

Existing cloud SLOs are more concerned with defending against corner cases than defining normal behavior. This and other tensions make SLOs surprisingly hard to define. We show that this problem shares some similarities with the challenges of applying statistics to make decisions based on sampled data. We argue that a mutually beneficial set of Service Level Expectations (SLEs) and Customer Behavior Expectations (CBEs) ameliorates many of the problems of today's SLOs by explicitly sharing risk between customer and service provider.},

  title      = {Revolutionizing Datacenter Networks via Reconfigurable Topologies},
  year       = {2025},
  abstract   = {With the popularity of cloud computing and data-intensive applications such as machine learning, datacenter networks have become a critical infrastructure for our digital society. Given the explosive growth of datacenter traffic and the slowdown of Moore's law, significant efforts have been made to improve datacenter network performance over the last decade. A particularly innovative solution is reconfigurable datacenter networks (RDCNs): datacenter networks whose topologies dynamically change over time, in either a demand-oblivious or a demand-aware manner. Such dynamic topologies are enabled by recent optical switching technologies and stand in stark contrast to state-of-the-art datacenter network topologies, which are fixed and oblivious to the actual traffic demand. In particular, reconfigurable demand-aware and 'self-adjusting' datacenter networks are motivated empirically by the significant spatial and temporal structures observed in datacenter communication traffic. This paper presents an overview of reconfigurable datacenter networks. In particular, we discuss the motivation for such reconfigurable architectures, review the technological enablers, and present a taxonomy that classifies the design space into two dimensions: static vs. dynamic and demand-oblivious vs. demand-aware. We further present a formal model and discuss related research challenges. Our article comes with complementary video interviews in which three leading experts, Manya Ghobadi, Amin Vahdat, and George Papen, share with us their perspectives on reconfigurable datacenter networks.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we analyze a performance model for the TCP Congestion Avoidance algorithm. The model predicts the bandwidth of a sustained TCP connection subjected to light to moderate packet losses, such as loss caused by network congestion. It assumes that TCP avoids retransmission timeouts and always has sufficient receiver window and sender data. The model predicts the Congestion Avoidance performance of nearly all TCP implementations under restricted conditions and of TCP with Selective Acknowledgements over a much wider range of Internet conditions.We verify the model through both simulation and live Internet measurements. The simulations test several TCP implementations under a range of loss conditions and in environments with both drop-tail and RED queuing. The model is also compared to live Internet measurements using the TReno diagnostic and real TCP implementations.We also present several applications of the model to problems of bandwidth allocation in the Internet. We use the model to analyze networks with multiple congested gateways; this analysis shows strong agreement with prior work in this area. Finally, we present several important implications about the behavior of the Internet in the presence of high load from diverse user communities.},

Digital byte streams from each terminal are partitioned into packets (blocks) and transmitted in a burst mode over a shared radio channel. When many terminals operate in this fashion, transmissions may conflict with and destroy each other. A means for controlling this is for the terminal to sense the presence of other transmissions; this leads to a new method for multiplexing in a packet radio environment: carrier sense multiple access (CSMA). Two protocols are described for CSMA and their throughput-delay characteristics are given. These results show the large advantage CSMA provides as compared to the random ALOHA access modes.},
