## Document Structure

The specification is organized into the following chapters:

1. **Chapter 1: Principles of Operation** -- Overview of high-level ideas behind atomic ethernet. Not meant to explain theory or implementation. It is to give a conceptual backplane for the rest of the document.
2. **Chapter 2: Bits and Bytes** -- Deep dive into the bits and bytes and frame formats of atomic ethernet. Explains the operation of each byte, and the state machines governing transitions.
3. **Chapter 3: Cells and Links** -- Explores the fundamental elements of atomic ethernet: CELLs (reactive, self-contained participants) and LINKs (bidirectional tunnel-elements between CELLs). Covers failure modes, discovery protocols, and the importance of triangular relationships for atomicity.
4. **Chapter 4: Addressing and Routing** -- Details the algorithm for building Trees and using trees to restrict addressability. Explains the shortcomings of source/destination addressing.
5. **Chapter 5: Transactions** -- Details the mathematical foundations of reversible transactions, including vector-based data modeling, invertible operations, and state updates. Specifies how transactions can be precisely undone for rollback, audit, and error recovery.
6. **Chapter 6: Architecture** -- Describes the slice engine design and architectural framework with four Shannon-like levels of information processing. Covers ANT and BEE scouting protocols for local and global network exploration.
7. **Chapter 7: Topology** -- Examines graph-aware determinism and network resilience metrics. Introduces concepts like algebraic connectivity and edge-disjoint paths to measure and ensure network robustness under failures.
8.  **Chapter 8: Ultra-Ethernet** -- Describes comparisons with various other network technologies (NVLink, UALink, Infiniband, Ethernet, Scale-Up Ethernet). Specifies Ultra Ethernet's scope, performance + scalability, open issues, and FITO analysis.
9. **Chapter 9: History** -- Traces the evolution of networking protocols from ALOHA to modern Ethernet, with special focus on ATM's flow control debates and InfiniBand's innovations in reliability and performance.
10. **Chapter 10: Theory** -- Challenges conventional networking concepts and terminology. Introduces new frameworks for understanding information, causality, and quantum mechanics in the context of distributed systems.
11. **Chapter 11: Requirements & Use Cases** --  Provides information on the functional requirements, scope, and analysis over the Open Atomic Ethernet Standard.



## Building the Document

### Prerequisites

- A LaTeX distribution (e.g., MacTex)
- The `tufte-book` document class
- Required LaTeX packages (specified in `oae-settings.tex`)

### Building

To build the complete specification:

```bash
latex OAE-SPEC-MAIN.tex
bibtex OAE-SPEC-MAIN.tex
latex OAE-SPEC-MAIN.tex
latex OAE-SPEC-MAIN.tex
```

This will generate `OAE-SPEC-MAIN.pdf` containing the complete specification.

### Structure

The main file is designed to be extremely simple, and require no changes
when writing new content other than adding new chapters.

```tex
\documentclass[justified,nobib,oneside]{tufte-book}

\input{oae-settings}
\input{oae-commands}

\title{Open Atomic \\ Ethernet}

\end{document}

```


## Chapters

### Structure

#### Chapters
Each chapter is stored in the `chapters/` directory as a separate `.tex` file. The main document (`OAE-SPEC-MAIN.tex`) includes these chapters using the `\subfile` command.

```tex
\documentclass[../../OAE-SPEC-MAIN.tex]{subfiles}

\title{Principles of Operation}

\begin{document}

\chapter{Principles of Operation}\label{sec:principles-of-operation}

\subfile{./section/intro.tex}
%...

\end{document}
```
##### Compilation

Each chapter is designed to compile into a PDF containing only the chapter content. No additional
changes or modifications to the preamble are required.

```bash
latex principles-of-operation.tex
bibtex principles-of-operation.tex
latex principles-of-operation.tex
latex principles-of-operation.tex
```

#### Sections
Similarly, each section content for a chapter is stored in the `section/` directory as individual `.tex` files. Each file is referenced in its respected `chapters/` file as a `subfile`.

```tex
\documentclass[../../../OAE-SPEC-MAIN.tex]{subfiles}


\begin{document}

\section{Introduction}

\end{document}
```

### Making Changes

When modifying a chapter, follow this workflow to ensure safe editing:

1. **Create a Working Copy**
   - Copy only the chapter you want to modify to a work-in-progress copy
   - Example: `chapters/[PLB]03_cells-and-links.tex`

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Edit the working copy
   - verify your changes locally with the per-chapter output PDF

3. **Replace Original**
   - Create a backup of the original chapter
   - Replace the original with your verified working copy
   - Ensure the full document compiles

4. **Create a new branch**
   - Create a new branch with the command `git checkout -b refactor/stuff`
   - Commit and push your branch to the github `git push --set-upstream origin refactor/stuff`
   - Create a pull request.

This workflow ensures you always have a backup and can verify changes before replacing the original file.
