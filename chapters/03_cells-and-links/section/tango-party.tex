\section{It takes Two to Tango, and Three to Party}

%\subsection{Alice, Bob, and Carol with 3 LINKs}

Because a single link between Alice and Bob can be causally disconnected by real-world, permanent or intermittent failures, an alternative: statistically--independent--failure--path is necessary, to recover from \LINK Failures.  % ADD MODAL LOGIC necessary, etc.
This is the heart of the  Ã† \texttt{ATOMICITY} claim:   A local (one hop \LINK) \texttt{TRIANGLE}  is the minimum necessary.  See TRIANGLE Clocks later in this specification.

Any one of which may be working in both directions: $\{11\}$, only one direction: $\{01\}$ or $\{10\}$, or \emph{not}-working in  \emph{both} directions: $\{11\}$. For 4 nodes, there are $\frac{(n(n-1)}{2} = 6$. With 4  \emph{reliability configurations} on each \LINK $\{00,01,10,11\}$ This gives us ONE correct (all links working correctly) and  $4^6-1 = 4095$ possible failure modes.}%\marginnote{permutations or combinations?}
