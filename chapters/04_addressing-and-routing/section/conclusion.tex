\section{Conclusion}

Chiplet interconnects require a blend of scalable discovery protocols and efficient forwarding strategies. By combining biologically inspired mechanisms (ants, bees, snakes, spiders) with low-overhead routing paradigms (worms), the network gains resilience, adaptability, and performance.

These approaches can be tuned to the chiplet topology and application domain, forming a foundation for robust next-generation system-on-chip communication fabrics.
